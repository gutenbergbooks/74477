<h1>ESSAYS IN MINIATURE</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OUR_FRIENDS_THE_BOOKS">OUR FRIENDS, THE BOOKS</h2>

</div>

<p>There is a short paragraph in Hazlitt’s
<i>Conduct of Life</i> that I read very often,
and always with fresh delight. He is offering
much good counsel to a little lad at school, and
when he comes to a matter upon which most
counselors are wont to be exceedingly didactic
and diffuse—the choice of books—he condenses
all he has to say into a few wise and
gentle words that are well worth taking to
heart:</p>

<p>“As to the works you will have to read by
choice or for amusement, the best are the commonest.
The names of many of them are already
familiar to you. Read them as you grow
up with all the satisfaction in your power, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
make much of them. It is perhaps the greatest
pleasure you will have in life, the one you
will think of longest, and repent of least. If
my life had been more full of calamity than it
has been (much more than yours, I hope, will
be) I would live it over again, my poor little
boy, to have read the books I did in my
youth.”</p>

<p>In all literature there is nothing truer or
better than this, and its sad sincerity contrasts
strangely with the general tone of the essay,
which is somewhat in the manner of Lord Chesterfield.
But here, at least, Hazlitt speaks with
the authority of one whose books had ever
been his friends; who had sat up all night as a
child over <i>Paul and Virginia</i>, and to whom the
mere sight of an odd volume of some good old
English author, on a street stall, brought back
with keen and sudden rapture the flavor of
those early joys which he remembered longest,
and repented least. His words ring consolingly
in these different days, when we have not
only ceased reading what is old, but when—a
far greater misfortune—we have forgotten how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
to read “with all the satisfaction in our power,”
and with a simple surrendering of ourselves
to the pleasure which has no peer. There are
so many things to be considered now besides
pleasure, that we have well-nigh abandoned
the effort to be pleased. In the first place, it
is necessary to “keep up” with a decent proportion
of current literature, and this means
perpetual labor and speed, whereas idleness
and leisure are requisite for the true enjoyment
of books. In the second place, few of us are
brave enough to withstand the pressure which
friends, mentors and critics bring to bear upon
us, and which effectually crushes anything like
the weak indulgence of our own tastes. The
reading they recommend being generally in the
nature of a corrective, it is urged upon us with
little regard to personal inclination; in fact, the
less we like it, the greater our apparent need.
There are people in this world who always insist
upon others remodeling their diet on a
purely hygienic basis; who entreat us to avoid
sweets or acids, or tea or coffee, or whatever
we chance to particularly like; who tell us persuasively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
that cress and dandelions will purify
our blood; that celery is an excellent febrifuge;
that shaddocks should be eaten for the
sake of their quinine, and fish for its phosphorus;
that stewed fruit is more wholesome than
raw; that rice is more nutritious than potatoes;—who
deprive us, in a word, of that hearty human
happiness which should be ours when dining.
Like Mr. Woodhouse, they are capable
of having the sweetbreads and asparagus carried
off before our longing eyes, and baked apples
provided as a substitute.</p>

<p>It is in the same benevolent spirit that kind-hearted
critics are good enough to warn us
against the books we love, and to prescribe for
us the books we ought to read. With robust
assurance they offer to give our tutelage their
own personal supervision, and their disinterested
zeal carries them occasionally beyond the
limits of discretion. I have been both amazed
and gratified by the lack of reserve with which
these unknown friends have volunteered to
guide my own footsteps through the perilous
paths of literature. They are so urgent, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
not to say severe, in their manner of proffering
assistance: “To Miss Repplier we would
particularly recommend”—and then follows a
list of books of which I dare say I stand in
open need; but which I am naturally indisposed
to consider with much kindness, thrust
upon me, as they are, like paregoric or a porous
plaster. If there be people who can take
their pleasures medicinally, let them read by
prescription and grow fat! But let me rather
keep for my friends those dear and familiar
volumes which have given me a large share of
my life’s happiness. If they are somewhat antiquated
and out of date, I have no wish to
flout their vigorous age. A book, Hazlitt reminds
us, is not, like a woman, the worse for
being old. If they are new, I do not scorn
them for a fault which is common to all their
kind. <i>Paradise Lost</i> was once new, and was
regarded as a somewhat questionable novelty.
If they come from afar, or are compatriots of
my own, they are equally well-beloved. There
can be no aliens in the ranks of literature, no
national prejudice in an honest enjoyment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
art. The book, after all, and not the date or
birthplace of its author, is of material importance.
“It seems ungracious to refuse to be a
<i>terræ filius</i>,” says Mr. Arnold; “but England
is not all the world.” Neither, for that matter,
is America, nor even Russia. The universe is
a little wider and a little older than we are
pleased to think, and to have lived long and
traveled far does not necessarily imply inferiority.
The volume that has crossed the seas,
the volume that has survived its generation,
stand side by side with their new-born American
brother, and there is no lack of harmony
in such close companionship. Books of every
age and of every nation show a charming
adaptability in their daily intercourse; and, if
left to themselves, will set off each other’s
merits in the most amiable and disinterested
manner, each one growing better by contact
with its excellent neighbor. It is only when
the patriotic critic comes along, and stirs up
dissensions in their midst, that this peaceful
atmosphere is rent with sudden discord; that
the English book grows disdainful and supercilious;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the American, aggressive and sarcastic;
the French, malicious and unkind. It is
only when we apply to them a test which is
neither wise nor worthy that they show all
their bad qualities, and afford a wrangling
ground for the ill-natured reviewers of two
continents.</p>

<p>There is a story told of the Russian poet,
Pushkin, which I like to think true, because it
is so pretty. When he was carried home fatally
wounded from the duel which cost him his
life, his young wife, who had been the innocent
cause of the tragedy, asked him whether
there were no relatives or friends whom he
wished to see summoned to his bedside. The
dying man lifted his heavy eyes to the shelf
where stood his favorite books, and murmured
faintly in reply, “Farewell, my friends.”
When we remember that Pushkin lived before
Russian literature had become a great and dispiriting
power, when we realize that he had
never been ordered by critics to read Turguéneff,
never commanded severely to worship
Tolstoi or be an outcast in the land, never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
even reveled in the dreadful gloom of Dostoïevsky,
it seems incredible to the well-instructed
that he should have loved his books
so much. It is absolutely afflicting to think
that many of these same volumes were foreign,
were romantic, perhaps even cheerful in their
character; that they were not his mentors, his
disciplinarians, his guides to a higher and sadder
life, but only his “friends.” Why, Hazlitt
himself could have used no simpler term of
endearment. Charles Lamb might have uttered
the very words when he closed his patient
eyes in the dull little cottage at Edmonton.
Sir Walter Scott might have murmured
them on that still September morn when the
clear rippling of the Tweed hushed his tired
heart to rest. I think that Shelley bade some
swift, unconscious farewell to all the dear delights
of reading, when he thrust into his pocket
the little volume of Keats, with its cover
bent hastily backward, and rose, still dreamy
with fairy-land, to face a sudden death. I
think that Montaigne bade farewell to the
fourscore “every-day books” that were his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
chosen companions, before turning serenely
away from the temperate pleasures of life.</p>

<p>For all these men loved literature, not contentiously,
nor austerely, but simply as their
friend. All read with that devout sincerity
which precludes petulance, or display, or lettered
asceticism, the most dismal self-torment
in the world. In that delicious dialogue of
Landor’s between Montaigne and Scaliger, the
scholar intimates to the philosopher that his
library is somewhat scantily furnished, and
that he and his father between them have written
nearly as many volumes as Montaigne possesses
on his shelves. “Ah!” responds the
sage with gentle malice, “to write them is
quite another thing; but one reads books without
a spur, or even a pat from our Lady
Vanity.”</p>

<p>Could anything be more charming, or more
untrue than this? Montaigne, perched tranquilly
on his Guyenne hill-slope, may have
escaped the goad; but we, the victims of our
swifter day, know too well how remorselessly
Lady Vanity pricks us round the course. Are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
we not perpetually showing our paces at her
command, and under the sharp incentive of
her heel? Yet Charles Lamb, in the heart of
London, preserved by some fine instinct the
same intellectual freedom that Montaigne
cherished in sleepy Gascony. He too was
fain to read for pleasure, and his unswerving
sincerity is no less enviable than the clearness
of his literary insight. Indeed, while many of
his favorite authors may have no message for
our ears, yet every line in which he writes his
love is pregnant with enjoyment; every word
expresses subtly a delicious sense of satisfaction.
The soiled and torn copies of <i>Tom
Jones</i> and <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i> from the
circulating library, which speak eloquently
to him of the thousand thumbs that have
turned over each well-worn page; the “kind-hearted
play-book” which he reaches down
from some easy shelf; the old <i>Town and
Country Magazine</i> which he finds in the window-seat
of an inn; the “garrulous, pleasant
history” of Burnet; the “beautiful, bare narrative”
of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>; the antiquated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
time-stained edition of “that fantastic old
great man,” Robert Burton; the Folio Beaumont
and Fletcher—all these and many more
are Lamb’s tried friends, and he writes of them
with lingering affection. He is even able,
through some fine choice of words, to convey
to us the precise degree and quality of pleasure
which they yield him, and which he wins us to
share, not by exhortations or reproaches, but
gently, with alluring smiles, and hinted promises
of reward. How craftily he holds each
treasured volume before our eyes! How apt
the brief, caressing sentence in which he sings
its praises!—“The sweetest names, and which
carry a perfume in the mention, are Kit Marlowe,
Drayton, Drummond of Hawthornden,
and Cowley.” “Milton almost requires a
solemn service of music to be played before
you enter upon him. Who listens, had need
bring docile thoughts, and purged ears.”
“Winter evenings—the world shut out—with
less of ceremony the gentle Shakespeare enters.
At such a season, the <i>Tempest</i>, or his
own <i>Winter’s Tale</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>In fact, the knowledge of when to read a
book is almost as valuable as the knowledge of
what book to read, and Lamb, as became a
true lover of literature, realized instinctively
that certain hours and certain places seem
created expressly for the supreme enjoyment
of an author, who yields to these harmonious
surroundings his best and rarest gifts. To
pick up <i>The Faerie Queene</i> as a stop-gap in the
five or six impatient minutes before dinner, to
carry <i>Candide</i> into the “serious avenues” of a
cathedral, to try and skim over Richardson
when in the society of a lively girl—Lamb
knew too well that these unholy feats are the
accomplishments of an intellectual acrobat,
not of a modest and simple-hearted reader.
Hazlitt also was keenly alive to the influences
of time and place. His greatest delight in poring
over the books of his youth lay in the
many recollections they aroused of scenes and
moments rich in vanished joys. He opened a
faded, dusty volume, and behold! the spot
where first he read it, the day it was received,
the feeling of the air, the fields, the sky, all returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
to him with charming distinctness, and
with them returned his first rapturous impression
of that long-closed, long-neglected romance:
“Twenty years are struck off the list,
and I am a child again.” Mr. Pater lays
especial emphasis on the circumstances under
which our favorite authors are read. “A
book,” he says, “like a person, has its fortunes
with one; is lucky or unlucky in the precise
moment of its falling in our way; and often,
by some happy accident, ranks with us for
something more than its independent value.”
Thus it is that Marius and Fabian, nestled in
the ripened corn amid the cool brown shadows,
receive from the <i>Golden Ass</i> of Apuleius a
strange keen pleasure; each lad taking from
the story that which he is best fitted to absorb;
each lad as unmindful of the other’s feelings as
of the grosser elements in the tale. For
without doubt a book has a separate message
for every reader, and tells him, of good
or evil, that which he is able to hear. Plato,
indeed, complains of all books that they lack
reticence or propriety toward different classes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of persons, and his protest embodies the aversion
of the flexible Greek mind for the precision
of written literature. A poem or an
oration which, crystallized into characters,
speaks to all alike, and reveals itself indiscriminately
to everybody, is of less value to the
ancient scholar than the poem or oration
which lingers in the master’s mind, and maintains
a delicate reserve toward the inferior
portion of the community. Plato is so far removed
from the modern spirit which seeks to
persuade the multitude to read Shakespeare
and Milton, that he practically resents their
peering with rude, but pardonable curiosity,
into the stately domains of genius. We have
now grown so insistently generous in these
matters that our unhappy brothers, harassed
beyond endurance, may well envy the plebeian
Greeks their merciful limitations; or wish, with
the little girl in <i>Punch</i>, that they had lived in
the time of Charles II., “for then education
was very much neglected.” But strive as we
may, we cannot coerce great authors into universal
complaisance. Plato himself, were he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
so unfortunate as to be living now, would recognize
and applaud their manifest reserves.
Even to the elect they speak with varying
voices, and it is sometimes difficult to believe
that all have read alike. When <i>Guy Mannering</i>
was first given to the public, who awaited
it with frantic eagerness, Wordsworth thoughtfully
observed that it was a novel in the style
of Mrs. Radcliffe. Murray, from whom one
expects more discernment, wrote to Hogg that
<i>Meg Merrilies</i> was worthy of Shakespeare;
“but all the rest of the novel might have been
written by Scott’s brother, or any other body.”
Blackwood, about the same time, wrote to
Murray: “If Walter Scott be the author of
<i>Guy Mannering</i>, he stands far higher in this
line than in his former walk.” One of these
verdicts has been ratified by time, but who
could suppose that Julia Mannering and honest
Dandy Dinmont would ever have whispered
such different messages into listening ears!</p>

<p>And it is precisely because of the independence
assumed by books, that we have need to
cherish our own independence in return. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
will not all be our friends, and not one of them
will give itself freely to us at the dictation of
a peremptory critic. Hazlitt says nobly of a
few great writers, notably Milton and Burke,
that “to have lived in the cultivation of an intimacy
with such works, and to have familiarly
relished such names, is not to have lived in
vain.” This is true, yet if we must seek for
companionship in less august circles, there are
many milder lights who shine with a steady
radiance. It is not the privilege of every one
to love so great a prose writer as Burke, so
great a poet as Milton. “An appreciation of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>,” says Mr. Mark Pattison, “is
the reward of exquisite scholarship;” and the
number of exquisite scholars is never very
large. To march up to an author as to the
cannon’s mouth is at best but unprofitable heroism.
To take our pleasures dutifully is the
least likely way to enjoy them. The laws of
Crete, it is said, were set to music, and sung
as alluringly as possible after dinner; but I
doubt if they afforded a really popular pastime.
The well-fed guests who listened to such decorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
chants applauded them probably from
the standpoint of citizenship, rather than from
any undisguised sentiment of enjoyment, and
a few degenerate souls must have sighed occasionally
over the joys of a rousing and unseemly
chorus. We of to-day are so rich in laws,
so amply disciplined at every turn, that we
have no need to be reminded at dinner of our
obligations. A kind-hearted English critic
once said that reading was not a duty, and
had therefore no business to be made disagreeable;
and that no man was under any obligation
to read what another man wrote. This is
an old-fashioned point of view, which has lost
favor of late years, but which is not without
compensations of its own. If the office of literature
be to make glad our lives, how shall we
seek the joy in store for us save by following
Hazlitt’s simple suggestion, and reading “with
all the satisfaction in our power”? And how
shall we insure this satisfaction, save by ignoring
the restrictions imposed upon us, and cultivating,
as far as we can, a sincere and pleasurable
intercourse with our friends, the books?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TRIALS_OF_A_PUBLISHER">TRIALS OF A PUBLISHER</h2>

</div>

<p>In reading the recently published <i>Memoirs
and Correspondence of John Murray</i>, a
very interesting and valuable piece of biography—albeit
somewhat lengthy for these
hurried days—we are forcibly impressed with
one surprising truth which we were far from
suspecting in our ignorance—namely, that the
publisher’s life, like the policeman’s, is not a
happy one, but filled to the brim with vexations
peculiarly his own. It was as much the
fashion in Murray’s time as it is in ours to bewail
the hard fate of down-trodden authors,
and to hint that he who prints the book absorbs
the praise and profit which belong in
justice to him who writes it. In fact, that
trenchant and time-honored jest, “Now Barabbas
was a publisher,” dates from this halcyon
period when <i>Marmion</i> was sold for a thousand
guineas, and the third canto of <i>Childe Harold</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
for nearly twice that sum. Murray himself
possessed such influence in the literary world
that the battle with the public was thought to
be half won when a book appeared armed with
the sanction of his name. He was a man of
wealth, too, of social standing, of severe and
fastidious tastes; exactly fitted by circumstances,
if not by nature, to play the autocratic
<i>rôle</i> popularly assigned to all his craft, to crush
the aspiring poet in the dust, to freeze the budding
genius who sought assistance at his hands,
to override with haughty arrogance the wan
and needy scholar who waited at his door.
Instead of this, we see him enduring with
lamblike gentleness an amount of provocation
which would have hallowed a mediæval saint,
and which seems to our undisciplined spirits
as wantonly exasperating and malign.</p>

<p>In the first place, his Scotch allies, Constable
and the ever-sanguine James Ballantyne,
appeared to have looked upon the English
firm as an inexhaustible mine of wealth,
from which they could, when convenient,
draw whatever they required. Ballantyne,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
especially, required so much, and required that
much so often, that Murray was obliged to
sever a connection too costly for his purse.
Then his partial ownership of <i>Blackwood’s
Magazine</i> was for years a thorn in his flesh,
and there is something truly pathetic in his
miserable attempts to modify the personalities
of that utterly irrepressible journal. “In the
name of God,” he writes vehemently to William
Blackwood, “why do you seem to think
it necessary that each number must give pain
to some one?” Even the <i>Quarterly</i>, his own
literary offspring, and the pride and glory of
his heart, was at times but a fractious child,
and cost him, after the fashion of children,
many sleepless nights. Gifford, the editor,
was incurably unbusinesslike in his habits,
and never could understand why subscribers
should complain and raise a row because the
magazine chanced to be a month or six weeks
late. It was sure to appear some time, and
they had all the pleasure of anticipation. It
was a point of honor with him, also, to conceal
the names of his contributors, so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
when offence was given to anybody—which
was pretty nearly always—the aggrieved person
immediately attacked Murray in return.
There are hosts of letters in these volumes
from indignant authors who express themselves
with true British candor because the
<i>Quarterly</i> has assailed their books, or their
friends’ books, or their friends’ friends’ books,
or their pet politicians, or their most cherished
political schemes. There are hosts of other
letters which merely record a distinctly unfavorable
opinion of the magazine’s literary
qualities, and which lament with pitiless
sincerity that the last number hardly contained
a single readable article.</p>

<p>All these annoyances, however, prickly
though they appear, are but trifles in comparison
with the extraordinary demands made
upon Murray as a publisher. Impecunious
playwrights, like poor Charles Maturin, pelt
him with unsalable dramas and heartrending
appeals for help. Impecunious essayists, like
Charles Marsh, send papers to the <i>Quarterly</i>,
and—before they are read—request fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
pounds, “as money on manuscript deposited.”
Impecunious patriots, like Foscolo—that
bright particular star of sentimental Liberals—demand
loans of a thousand pounds, to be
repaid with literary work. Impecunious poets,
like James Hogg, borrow fifty pounds with the
lofty patronage of sovereigns. It is very amusing
to note the tone assumed by the Ettrick
Shepherd in his intercourse with a man of
Murray’s influence and position. When he is
in a good humor, that is, when he has negotiated
a successful loan, he writes in this generous
fashion: “Though I have heard some bitter
things against you, I never met with any man
whatever who, on so slight an acquaintance,
has behaved to me so much like a gentleman.”
Or again, “You may be misled, and you may
be mistaken, my dear Murray, but as long as
you tell me the simple truth as plainly, you
and I will be friends.” If things go haltingly,
however, and there is a delay in forwarding
cheques, this magnificent condescension sharpens
into angry protest. “What the deuce,”
he writes vehemently, “have you made of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
excellent poem,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that you are never publishing
it, while I am starving for money, and cannot
even afford a Christmas goose to my friends?”
When a new edition of <i>The Queen’s Wake</i> was
printed in Edinburgh, a very handsome quarto
selling for a guinea—which seems a heart-breaking
price—Murray with his usual generosity
subscribed for twenty-five copies; whereupon
we find Hogg promptly acknowledging
this munificence by begging him to persuade
others to do likewise. “You must make a
long pull and a strong pull in London for subscriptions,”
he writes, with enviable composure,
“as you and Mr. Rogers are the principal
men I have to rely on.” There is something
very tranquillizing in the gentle art of shifting
one’s burdens to other shoulders. Genius
flourishes like the mountain oak when it can
strike root in the money-boxes of less gifted
friends.</p>

<p>If tact and patience were both required in
soothing Hogg’s petulant vanity and in providing
for his extravagant habits, the task became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
harder and more thankless when Leigh
Hunt presented himself in the field. I can
imagine few things more delightful than to
have had money transactions with a person of
Leigh Hunt’s peculiar and highly original
methods. He was a kind of literary Oliver,
crying perpetually for more. When the
<i>Story of Rimini</i> was still uncompleted, it was
offered by the poet to Murray with this
diverting assurance:</p>

<p>“Booksellers tell me I ought not to ask less
than four hundred and fifty pounds (which is a
sum I happen to want just now), and my
friends, not in the trade, say I ought not to
ask less than five hundred, with such a trifling
acknowledgment upon the various editions,
after the second and third, as shall enable me
to say that I am still profiting by it.”</p>

<p>Murray, evidently disconcerted by the coolness
of this proposal, writes back with veiled
and courteous sarcasm, suggesting that the
manuscript be offered upon these terms to
other publishers. Should they refuse to accept
it, he is willing to print a small edition at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
his own expense, and divide the profits with
the author, to whom the copyright shall be restored.
Rather to our amazement, and perhaps
to Murray’s, Leigh Hunt closes immediately
with this very moderate offer; and
as soon as the book appears he writes again,
begging to have part of the money advanced
to him. Murray’s reply is eminently characteristic
of the man. The poem, he says, is
selling well. Should the entire edition be exhausted,
which he doubts not will be the case,
the poet’s share of the profits would amount to
exactly forty-eight pounds and ten shillings.
He takes pleasure in enclosing a cheque for
fifty pounds, and only asks that a receipt may
be sent him for the same. The receipt is not
sent until ten days are past, when it arrives
accompanied by a long letter in which Leigh
Hunt enlarges upon his pecuniary troubles—concerning
these he is as explicit as Micawber—and
proposes that Murray should now purchase
the copyright of <i>Rimini</i> for four hundred
and fifty pounds, and let him have the money
at once. Unhappily, the answer to this admirable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
piece of negotiation has been lost, but it
was evidently too patronizing to please the
poet, who was as sensitive as he was insatiable.
The next letter we have from him sharply reminds
Murray that he is not seeking for assistance,
but merely endeavoring to transact a
piece of business which would involve no possible
risk for any one. Finally the poor harassed
publisher persuades him with soft words
to sell the copyright of <i>Rimini</i> to another
firm, and there must have been a deep breath
of relief drawn in Albemarle Street when the
matter was at last adjusted, and the troublesome
correspondence ceased. In fact, there
is a letter from Blackwood frankly congratulating
Murray on his escape. “I dare say you
are well rid of Leigh Hunt,” writes this experienced
ally to his fellow-sufferer; “and I
really pity you when I think of the difficulty
you must often have in managing with authors,
and particularly with the friends of authors
whom you wish to oblige.”</p>

<p>One of those whom Murray wished eagerly
to oblige, until he found the task too costly for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
his purse, was Madame de Staël. For the
English and French editions of her work on
Germany he paid no less than fifteen hundred
pounds, and speedily found himself a loser by
the transaction. Gifford, who had scant liking
for the celebrated “hurricane in petticoats,”
writes to him on the occasion with gentle
malice, and a too evident amusement at his
discomfiture: “I can venture to assure you
that the hope of keeping her from the press is
quite vain. The family of Œdipus were not
more haunted and goaded by the Furies than
the Neckers, father, mother, and daughter,
have always been by the demon of publication.
Madame de Staël will therefore write and print
without intermission.” Not without being well
paid, however; for three years later we find
the Baron de Staël writing to Murray in his
mother’s name, and demanding four thousand
pounds for her three-volume work, <i>Des Causes
et des Effets de la Révolution Française</i>. “My
mother <i>insists</i> upon four thousand pounds,
besides a credit in books for every new edition,”
says this imperative gentleman, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
in the manner of a footpad; to whom
Murray responds with much tranquillity,
thanking him for his “obliging letter,” and
intimating that he and Longman together are
willing to pay one thousand pounds for the
first French and English editions, and three
hundred and fifty pounds for the second.
Madame de Staël indignantly repudiates this
offer, declaring that twenty-five hundred
pounds is the least she can think of taking,
and that the book will be a bargain at such a
price. Murray, who knows something about
bargains, and who has been rendered more
cautious than usual by his experience with
<i>L’Allemagne</i>, declines such palpable risks, and
excuses himself from further negotiations. <i>La
Révolution Française</i> did not appear until after
Madame de Staël’s death, when it was published
by Messrs. Baldwin and Cradock, and
proved a lamentable failure, people having
begun by that time to grow a trifle weary of
such a thrice-told tale.</p>

<p>The most amusing and at the same time most
pathetic bit of correspondence in these two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
big volumes relates to a translation of <i>Faust</i>,
which Coleridge, so eminently qualified for the
task, offers to write for Murray. He unfolds
his views in a letter as long as an average
essay—or what we call an essay in these degenerate
days—evincing on every page a superb
contempt for the reading public, which
was expected to buy the book, a painful reluctance
to “attempt anything of a literary
nature with any motive of pecuniary advantage”—which
does not prevent him from doing
some elaborate bargaining later on—and a
tendency to plunge into intellectual abstractions,
calculated to chill the heart of the stoutest
publisher in Christendom. There is one
incomparable paragraph which Coleridge alone
could have written, and a portion of which—only
a portion—I cannot refrain from quoting:</p>

<p>“Any work in Poetry strikes me with more
than common awe, as proposed for realization
by myself, because from long habits of meditation
on language, as the symbolic medium of
the connection of Thought with Thought as
affected and modified by Passion and Emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
I should spend days in avoiding what I deemed
faults, though with the full foreknowledge that
their admission would not have offended three
of all my readers, and might perhaps be deemed
beauties by three hundred—if so many there
were; and this not out of any respect for the
public (<i>i.e.</i>, the persons who might happen to
purchase and look over the book) but from a
hobby-horsical, superstitious regard to my own
feelings and sense of Duty. Language is the
sacred Fire in this Temple of Humanity, and
the Muses are its especial and vestal priestesses.
Though I cannot prevent the vile drugs and
counterfeit Frankincense which render its
flames at once pitchy, glowing, and unsteady,
I would yet be no voluntary accomplice in the
Sacrilege. With the commencement of a Public,
commences the degradation of the Good
and the Beautiful—both fade and retire before
the accidentally Agreeable. <i>Othello</i> becomes
a hollow lip-worship; and the <i>Castle
Spectre</i>, or any more peccant thing of Froth,
Noise, and Impermanence, that may have over-billowed
it on the restless sea of curiosity, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
the true Prayer of the Praise and Admiration.”</p>

<p>Fancy the feelings of a poor publisher assailed
with this raging torrent of words! Murray,
stemming the tide as best he can, replies
in a short, businesslike note, proposing terms—not
very liberal ones—for the desired translation.
Whereupon Coleridge writes a second
letter, actually longer than the first, intimating
that a hundred pounds is but scant remuneration
for such a piece of work, “executed
as alone I can or dare do it—that is, to the
utmost of my power; for which the intolerable
Pain, nay the far greater Toil and Effort of
doing otherwise, is a far safer Pledge than any
solicitude on my part concerning the approbation
of the Public.”</p>

<p>Finally, the undertaking was abandoned,
and the English-speaking world lost its single
chance of having <i>Faust</i> adequately translated;
lost it, I truly believe, through the reluctance
of even a patient man to stomach any
further correspondence.</p>

<p>Trials of a very different order poured in on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Murray through his connection with Lord
Byron, an honor which was not altogether
without thorns. People who thought Byron’s
poetry immoral wrote frankly to Murray to say
so. People who did not think Byron’s poetry
immoral wrote quite as frankly to complain of
those who did. His noble lordship himself
was at times both petulant and exacting, and
there is a ring of true dignity in the following
remonstrance offered by the publisher to the
peer, by “Mr. Bookseller Murray,” as Napier
contemptuously calls him, to the poet whose
good qualities he was so quick to understand:</p>

<p>“I assure you,” he writes, “that I take no
umbrage at irritability which will occasionally
burst from a mind like yours; but I sometimes
feel a deep regret that in our pretty long intercourse
I appear to have failed to show that a
man in my situation may possess the feelings
and principles of a gentleman. Most certainly
do I think that, from personal attachment, I
could venture as much in any shape for your
service as any of those who have the good fortune
to be ranked amongst your friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>In fact, the friends of authors were too often,
as Blackwood hinted, the sources of Murray’s
severest trials. Friends are obliging creatures
in their way, and always ready to give with
lavish hearts their wealth of criticism and opinion.
There is a delightful letter from the Rev.
H. H. Milman, Dean of St. Paul’s, offering to
Murray his sadly unreadable poem <i>Belshazzar</i>,
with this timely intimation: “I give you
fair warning that all the friends who have
hitherto seen it assure me that I shall not do
myself justice unless I demand a very high
price for it.” Murray, in reply, hints as urbanely
as he can that, as it is he and not Mr.
Milman’s friends who is to pay the price, he
cannot accept their judgment in the matter as
final; he is compelled to take into consideration
his own chances of profit. Throughout
all his correspondence we note this tone of
careful self-repression, of patient and courteous
kindness. Now and then only, particularly
trying letters appear to have been left unanswered,
as though the limits of even his endurance
had been reached. When we remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
that the <i>Quarterly</i> was the cherished idol of
his life, and that his pride and delight in it
knew no bounds, we can dimly appreciate his
feelings on receiving the following lines from
Southey, whose principal income for years had
been derived from the magazine’s most liberal
and open-handed payments. “It is a great
price,” writes the author of <i>Thalaba</i>, who has
just pocketed a comfortable sum, “and it is
very convenient for me to receive it. But I
will tell you, with that frankness which you
have always found in my correspondence and
conversation, that I must suspect my time
might be more profitably employed (as I am
sure it might be more worthily) than in writing
for your journal, even at that price.”</p>

<p>I am not wont to peer too closely into the
secrets of the human heart, but I would like to
know exactly how Murray felt when he read
that letter. “Let me at least be eaten by a
lion!” says Epictetus. “Let me at least be
insulted by a genius!” might well have been
the publisher’s lament.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_OPPRESSION_OF_NOTES">THE OPPRESSION OF NOTES</h2>

</div>

<p>That innocent nondescript, the average
reader, is suffering very sorely at the
present day from what might be justly called
the oppression or tyranny of notes. I hear,
indeed, from time to time, bitter complaints of
editorial inaccuracy, of the unscholarly treatment
of quite forgotten masterpieces by the
industrious gentlemen who seek to reintroduce
them to the public; but such inaccuracy can
wound only the limited number who know
more than the editor, and who in their secret
souls are not sorry to prove him wrong. The
average reader, even though he hold himself
to be of moderate intelligence, is happily ignorant
of such fine shadings, and only asks
that he may enjoy his books in a moderately
intelligent manner; that he may be helped
over hedges and ditches, and allowed to ramble
unmolested where the ground seems tolerably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
smooth. This is precisely the privilege,
however, which a too liberal editor is disinclined
to allow. He will build you a bridge
over a raindrop, put ladders up a pebble, and
encompass you on every side with ingenious
alpenstocks and climbing-irons; yet when,
perchance, you stumble and hold out a hand
for help, behold, he is never there to grasp it.
He merely refers you, with some coldness, to
a remote authority who will give you the assistance
you require when you have reached the
end of your journey. Mr. Ritchie, for example,
who has recently edited a volume of Mrs.
Carlyle’s early letters, expects you patiently
to search for the information you want in Mr.
Froude’s pages, which is always a disheartening
thing to be asked to do. Yet when Jeanie
Welsh, writing cheerfully of an inconstant
lover, says, “<i>Mais n’importe!</i> It is only one
more Spanish castle demolished; another may
start up like a mushroom in its place;” an explanatory
note carefully reveals to you that
“Spanish castle” really means “château en
Espagne”—a circumstance which even Macaulay’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
schoolboy would probably have deciphered
for himself.</p>

<p>If it be hard on the average reader to be referred
chillingly to modern writers who are at
least within approachable distance, it is harder
still to be requested to look up classical authorities.
If it be hard to be told occasionally
by that prince of good editors, Mr. Alfred
Ainger, to please turn elsewhere for the little
bits of information which we think he might
give us about Charles Lamb, it is harder still
to have Mr. Wright refuse to translate for us
Edward Fitzgerald’s infrequent lapses into
Greek. What is the use of saying in a note
“v. 9” when Fitzgerald quotes Herodotus? If
I can read the quotation for myself, I have no
need to hunt up v. 9; and if I can’t, v. 9 is of
no use to me when found. Even “Hor. Od. I.
4, 14, 15,” is not altogether satisfactory to the
indifferent scholar, for whom Fitzgerald himself
had such generous sympathy, and for
whom his translations were avowedly undertaken.</p>

<p>These are merely cases, however, in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
notes refuse to be helpful; they are apt to become
absolutely oppressive when accompanying
older writers. A few years ago I bought
a little English edition of the <i>Religio Medici</i>,
to which are added the <i>Letter to a Friend</i> and
<i>Christian Morals</i>. The book is one of Macmillan’s
Golden Treasury Series, and is edited
by Mr. W. A. Greenhill, who opens with an
“Editor’s Preface,” eighteen pages long, and
fairly bristling with knowledge points. After
this come a “Chronological Table of Dates, Connected
with Sir Thomas Browne,” two pages
long; “Note on the Discovery of the Remains
of Sir Thomas Browne in 1840,” two pages;
“Brief Notices of Former Editors of the <i>Religio
Medici</i>,” four pages; “List of Editions of <i>Religio
Medici</i>,” thirteen pages; “Collations of Some
Old Editions of <i>Religio Medici</i>,” three pages;
“List of Editions of <i>Letter to a Friend</i> and
<i>Christian Morals</i>,” five pages; “<i>Addenda et
Corrigenda</i>,” one page. Having thus laboriously
cleared the way, we are at last gladdened by a
sight of the <i>Religio Medici</i> itself, which, together
with the <i>Letter</i> and <i>Christian Morals</i>, occupies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
two hundred and thirty pages. Then, following
close, like the mighty luggage of a Persian army,
come an array of “Notes Critical and Explanatory,”
eighty-eight pages; and an Index just
sixty-nine pages long. Thus it will be seen that
two hundred and five pages of editorial work
are deemed necessary to elucidate two hundred
and thirty pages of Sir Thomas Browne, which
seems like an intolerable deal of sack for such
a quantity of bread. To compress all this into
a small volume requires close printing and
flimsy paper, and the ungrateful reader thinks
in his hardened heart that he would rather a
little more space had been given to the author,
and a little less to the editor, who is for most
of us, after all, a secondary consideration. It
is also manifestly impossible, with such a number
of notes, even to refer to them at the bottom
of the page; yet without this guiding finger
they are often practically useless. We are not
as a rule aware, when we read, what information
we lack, and it becomes a grievous duty
to examine every few minutes and see if we
ought not to be finding something out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>A glance at the notes themselves is very
discouraging:</p>

<p>“P. 10, l. 14, directed, <span class="allsmcap">A</span> to <span class="allsmcap">E</span>, <span class="allsmcap">G</span>; direct, <span class="allsmcap">F</span>,
<span class="allsmcap">H</span> to <span class="allsmcap">L</span>.</p>

<p>“P. 10, l. 16, rectified, <span class="allsmcap">A</span> to <span class="allsmcap">I</span>; rectified, <span class="allsmcap">J</span>,
<span class="allsmcap">K</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L</span>.</p>

<p>“P. 10, l. 28, consist, <span class="allsmcap">A</span> to <span class="allsmcap">J</span>; resist, <span class="allsmcap">K</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L</span>.”</p>

<p>Reading with such helps as these becomes a
literary nightmare:</p>

<p>“P. 8, l. 8, distinguished] Chapman (<span class="allsmcap">R</span>) and
Gardiner (<span class="allsmcap">W</span>) read ‘being distinguished.’</p>

<p>“P. 8, l. 8, distinguished not only] Wilkin
(<span class="allsmcap">T</span>) read ‘not only distinguished.’”</p>

<p>And this is weirder still:</p>

<p>“P. 59, l. 4, antimetathesis, <span class="allsmcap">C</span> to <span class="allsmcap">M</span>; antanaclasis,
<span class="allsmcap">A</span>, <span class="allsmcap">B</span>; transposition of words, <span class="allsmcap">N</span>, <span class="allsmcap">O</span>.”</p>

<p>It may easily be surmised that eighty-eight
pages of such concentrated and deadly erudition
weigh very heavily on the unscholarly
soul. We are reminded forcibly of the impatience
manifested by Mr. E. S. Dallas, in <i>The
Gay Science</i>, over Person’s notes on Euripides,
from which he had hoped so much and gleaned
so little; which were all about words and less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
than words—syllables, letters, accents, punctuation.</p>

<p>“Codex A and Codex B, Codex Cantabrigiensis
and Codex Cottonianus, were ransacked
in turn to show how this noun should be in the
dative, not in the accusative; how that verb
should have the accent paroxytone, not perispomenon;
and how, by all the rules of prosody,
there should be an iambus, not a spondee,
in this place or that.” The lad who has
heard all his college life about the wonderful
supplement to the <i>Hecuba</i> turns to it with
wistful eyes, expecting to find some subtle key
to Greek tragedy. “Behold, it is a treatise on
certain Greek metres. Its talk is of cæsural
pauses, penthemimeral and hephthemimeral,
of isochronous feet, of enclitics and cretic terminations;
and the grand doctrine it promulgates
is expressed in the canon regarding the
pause which, from the discoverer, has been
named the Porsonian—that when the iambic
trimeter after a word of more than one syllable
has the cretic termination included either in
one word or in two, then the fifth foot must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
an iambus. The young student throws down
the book thus prefaced and supplemented, and
wonders if this be all that giants of Porsonian
height can see or care to speak about in Greek
literature.”</p>

<p>But then be it remembered that Euripides, as
edited by Porson, was intended for the use of
scholars, and there exists an impression—perhaps
erroneous—that this is the sort of food for
which scholars hunger and thirst. Sir Thomas
Browne has, happily, not yet passed out of the
hands of the general reader, whose appetite for
intellectual abstraction and the rigors of precision
is distinctly moderate, and in whose behalf
I urge my plea to-day.</p>

<p>After the oppressively erudite notes come
those which interpret trifles with painstaking
fidelity, and which reveal to us the meaning of
quite familiar words. In Ferrier’s admirable
edition of the <i>Noctes Ambrosianæ</i>, for example,
we are told with naïve gravity that “wiselike”
means “judicious,” that “glowering” means
“staring,” that “parritch” is “porridge,” that
“guffaw” is a “loud laugh,” that “douce” is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
“sedate,” that “gane” is “gone,” and that “in
a jiffy” means “immediately.” But surely the
readers of Christopher North do not require
information like this. “Douce” and “parritch”
and “guffaw” are not difficult words to
understand, and “in a jiffy” would seem to
come within the intellectual grasp of many who
have not yet made the acquaintance of the alphabet.</p>

<p>It may be, however, that there are people
who really like to be instructed in this manner,
just as there are people who like to go to lectures
and to organ recitals. It may even be
that a taste for notes, like a taste for gin, or opium,
or Dr. Ibsen’s dramas, increases with what
it feeds on. In that tiny volume of <i>Selected
Poems</i> by Gray which Mr. Gosse has edited for
the Clarendon Press, there are forty-two pages
of notes to sixty pages of poetry; and while
some of them are valuable and interesting,
many more seem strangely superfluous. But
Mr. Gosse, who has his finger on the literary
pulse of his generation, is probably the last
man in England to furnish information unless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
it is desired. He knows, better than most purveyors
of knowledge, what it is that readers
want; he is not prone to waste his precious
minutes; he has a saving sense of humor; and
he does not aspire to be a lettered philanthropist
fretting to enlighten mankind. If, then, he
finds it necessary to elucidate that happy trifle,
<i>On the Death of a Favorite Cat</i>, with no less
than seven notes, which is at the rate of one
for every verse, it must be that he is filling an
expressed demand; it must be that he is aware
that modern students of Gray—every one who
reads a poet is a “student” nowadays—like to
be told by an editor about Tyrian purple, and
about Arion’s dolphin, and about the difference
between a tortoise-shell and a tabby. As for
the seven pages of notes that accompany the
<i>Elegy</i>, they carry me back in spirit to the friend
of my childhood, Miss Edgeworth’s Rosamond,
who was expected to understand every word of
every poem she studied. What a blessing Mr.
Gosse’s notes would have been to that poor,
dear, misguided little girl, who rashly committed
the <i>Elegy</i> to memory because, in honest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
childish fashion, she loved its pretty sound!
Who can forget the pathetic scene where she
attempts to recite it, and has only finished the
first line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">when Godfrey, whom I always thought, and
still think, a very disagreeable boy, interrupts
her ruthlessly.</p>

<p>“‘What is meant by the “curfew”? What
is meant by “tolls”? What is a “knell”?
What is meant by “parting day”?’</p>

<p>“‘Godfrey, I cannot tell the meaning of every
word, but I know the general meaning. It
means that the day is going, that it is evening,
that it is growing dark. Now let me go on.’</p>

<p>“‘Go on,’ said Godfrey, ‘and let us see what
you will do when you come to “the boast of
heraldry,” to “the long-drawn aisle and fretted
vault,” to the “village Hampden,” to “some
mute inglorious Milton,” and to “some Cromwell
guiltless of his country’s blood,” you who
have not come to Cromwell yet, in the history
of England.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>No wonder poor Rosamond is disheartened
and silenced by such an array of difficulties in
her path. It is comforting to know that Godfrey
himself comes to grief, a little later, with
<i>The Bard</i>, and that even the wise and irreproachable
Laura confesses to have been baffled
by the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If aught of oaten stop or pastoral song</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May hope, chaste eve, to soothe thy modest ear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Oaten stop” was a mystery, and “eve” she
thought—and was none the worse for thinking
it—meant our first great erring mother.</p>

<p>No such wholesome blunders—pleasant to recall
in later, weary, well-instructed days—would
be possible for Miss Edgeworth’s little people
if they lived in our age of pitiless enlightenment,
when even a book framed for their especial
joy, like <i>The Children’s Treasury of
English Song</i>, bristles with marginal notes.
Here Rosamond would have found an explanation
of no less than forty-eight words in the
<i>Elegy</i>, and would probably have understood it
a great deal better, and loved it a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
less. It is healthy and natural for a child to be
forcibly attracted by what she does not wholly
comprehend; the music of words appeals very
sweetly to childish ears, and their meaning
comes later—comes often after the first keen
unconscious pleasure is past. I once knew a
tiny boy who so delighted in Byron’s description
of the dying gladiator that he made me
read it to him over, and over, and over again.
He did not know—and I never told him—what
a gladiator was. He did not know that it was
a statue, and not a real man, described. He
had not the faintest notion of what was meant
by the Danube, or the “Dacian mother,” or “a
Roman holiday.” Historically and geographically,
the boy’s mind was a happy blank.
There was nothing intelligent or sagacious in
his enjoyment; only a blissful stirring of the
heartstrings by reason of strong words, and
swinging verse, and his own tangle of groping
thoughts. But what child who reads Cowper’s
pretty remonstrance to his spaniel, and the
spaniel’s neat reply, wants to be told in a succession
of dismal notes that “allures” means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
“tempts,” that “remedy” means “cure,” that
“killing time” means “wasting time,” that “destined”
means “meant for,” and that “behest”
means “command”? Cowper is one of the simplest
of writers, and the little boys and girls
who cannot be trusted unarmed in his company
had better confine their reading to <i>Robinson
Crusoe in Words of One Syllable</i>, or to
the veracious pages of <i>Mother Goose</i>. But
perhaps the day is not far distant when even
<i>Mother Goose</i> will afford food for instruction
and a fresh industry for authors, and when the
hapless children of the dawning century will
be confronted with a dozen highly abbreviated
and unintelligible notes referring them to some
Icelandic Saga or remote Indian epic for the
bloody history of the <i>Three Blind Mice</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONVERSATION_IN_NOVELS">CONVERSATION IN NOVELS</h2>

</div>

<p>A great many years ago, when I was a
little girl, I used to know a dear, placid,
sunny-tempered old lady who was stone-deaf
and an insatiable novel-reader. She always
came to our house bearing a black bag which
held her jointed ear-trumpet, and she always
left it with a borrowed novel under her arm.
As she had reached that comfortable period of
life when a book is as easily forgotten as read,
our slender library supplied all her demands,
on the same principle of timely reappearance
which makes an imposing stage army out of
two dozen elusive supernumeraries. She had
a theory of selection all her own, and to which
she implicitly trusted. She glanced over a
story very rapidly, and if it had too many solid,
page-long paragraphs—reflections, descriptions,
etc.—she put it sadly but steadfastly
aside. If, on the contrary, it was well broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
up into conversations, which always impart an
air of sprightliness to a book, she said she was
sure she would like it, and carried it off in triumph.</p>

<p>Those were not days, be it remembered,
when people wrote fiction for the sake of introducing
discussions. There still lingered in
the novelist’s mind the time-worn heresy that
he had a story to tell, and that his people must
act as well as talk. The plot—delightful and
obsolete word!—was then in good repute, and
conversation was mainly useful in helping on
the tale, in providing copious love scenes, and,
with really good novelists, in illustrating and
developing character. Thomas Love Peacock’s
inimitable dialogues had indeed been long
given to the world; but quiet people of restricted
cultivation knew nothing of them, and would
have found it difficult to realize their loss. I
can hardly fancy our dear old friend reading
and enjoying the delicious war of words in
<i>Crotchet Castle</i>, and I should be grieved to
think of her suddenly confronted with those
scraps of sententious wisdom, in which its author<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
took a truly impish and reprehensible delight.
Such a sentiment as “Men have been
found very easily permutable into ites and
onians, avians and arians,” might have sorely
puzzled her benign and tranquil soul.</p>

<p>Yet no one can accuse Peacock of writing
his novels in order to express his own personal
convictions. The fact is that, after reading
them, we are often very much in the dark as
to what his convictions were. We know he
loved old things better than new ones, and
wine better than water; and that is about as
far as we can follow him with security. “The
intimate friends of Mr. Peacock may have understood
his political sentiments,” says Lord
Houghton disconsolately, “but it is extremely
difficult to discover them from his work.” His
people simply talk in character, sometimes
tiresomely, sometimes with unapproachable
keenness and humor, and the scope of his stories
hardly permits any near approach to the
fine gradations, the endless variety, of life.
Mr. Chainmail never opens his lips save in
praise of feudalism. Mr. Mac Quedy discusses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
political economy only. Even the witty Dr.
Folliott, “a fellow of infinite jest,” seldom gets
beyond the dual delights of Greek and dining.
It is all vastly piquant and entertaining, but it
is leagues away from the casual conversation,
the little leisurely, veracious gossip in which
Jane Austen reveals to us with merciless distinctness
the secret springs that move a human
heart. She has scant need to describe her
characters, and she seldom takes that trouble.
They betray themselves at every word, and
stand convicted on their own evidence. We
are not warned in advance against Isabella
Thorpe. We meet her precisely as Catherine
meets her in the Pump-room at Bath, where
the young lady speedily opens her lips, and
acquaints us in the most vivacious manner with
her own callous folly and selfishness. Every
syllable uttered by Mrs. Norris is a new and
luminous revelation; we know her just that
much better than we did before she spoke.
Even <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, by no means the
best of Miss Austen’s novels, starts with that
admirable discussion between Mr. John Dashwood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and his wife on the subject of his mother’s
and sisters’ maintenance. It is a short chapter,
the second in the book, and at its close we are
masters of the whole situation. We have
sounded the feeble egotism of Mr. Dashwood,
and the adroit meanness of his spouse. We know
precisely what degree of assistance Elinor and
Marianne are likely to receive from them. We
foresee the relation these characters will bear
to each other during the progress of the story,
and we have been shown with delicious humor
how easy and pleasant is the task of self-deception.
That a girl of nineteen should have
been capable of such keenly artistic work is
simply one of the miracles of literature; and
the more we think about it, the more miraculous
it grows. The best we can do is to bow
our heads, and pay unqualified homage at its
shrine.</p>

<p>Some portion of Jane Austen’s ability for
portraying character in conversation is discernible
in at least one of her too numerous successors
in the craft. The authoress of <i>Mademoiselle
Ixe</i> and of <i>Cecilia de Noël</i> has already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
proven to the world how deft and skilful is
her manipulation of that difficult medium,
drawing-room gossip. It would be unjust and
absurd to compare her stories, slight and unsubstantial
as pencil sketches, with the finished
masterpieces of English fiction; but there are
touches in these modern tales which convince
even a casual reader of splendid possibilities
ahead. The setting of <i>Mademoiselle Ixe</i> is so
fine, the lightly drawn English people who surround
the mysterious governess and her still
more mysterious victim are so real, that we
cease to ask ourselves obtrusive questions concerning
the purpose and utility of the crime.
Better still are some of the scenes in <i>Cecilia de
Noël</i>, where Lady Atherley’s serene and imperturbable
good sense tempers the atmosphere,
and gives exactly the proper effect to her husband’s
rather long-winded eloquence, to Mrs.
Mostyn’s amiable and cruel evangelism, and
to Mrs. Molyneux’s amusing eccentricities. All
these characters have individuality of their
own, and all reveal themselves through the intricacies
of conversation, while occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
there is a felicitous touch worthy of Jane Austen’s
hand; as when Lady Atherley listens
tranquilly to Mrs. Mostyn’s tirade against the
ritualistic curate, and evolves from it the one
judicious conclusion that he is evidently an
Austyn of Temple Leigh, and that it would be
desirable to ask him to dinner.</p>

<p>The real drawback to Lanoe Falconer’s art
is, not the brevity of her work, but the fact that
her people cannot develop on purely natural
lines, because they are hampered by the terrible
necessity of illustrating a moral; and
even in their most unguarded moments the
task assigned them is never wholly laid aside.
It is seldom that a good tract is a good story
too, and all the novelist’s skill is powerless to
impart a vivid semblance of truth to characters
who have to “talk up” to a given subject, and
teach a given lesson. The inartistic treatment
of material results, curiously enough, in weakening
our sense of reality; yet if the authoress
of <i>Cecilia de Noël</i> would consent, for a few
short years, to abandon social and spiritual
problems, to concern herself as little with Nihilism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
as with eternal punishment, but to be
content, as Jane Austen was content, with telling
a story, perhaps that story might be no
unworthy successor of those matchless tales
which are our refuge and solace in these dark
days of ethical and unorthodox fiction.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of charming conversation,
which is not as well known as it should
be, in the best novels of Anthony Trollope.
He gives his characters plenty of time and opportunity
to talk, without forcing them into
arbitrary channels; and occasionally, as with
Mrs. Proudie and Archdeacon Grantly, and
Lady Glencora, he persuades them to let us
know exactly what kind of people they are.
Above all, there is such an air of veracity about
his causeries that the most skeptical reader
listens to them without a shadow of doubt.
Who can ever forget Bertie Stanhope intimating
to Bishop Proudie that he had once thought
of being a prelate himself, or Lady Glencora’s
midnight confidences to Alice, or that crucial
contest between Dr. Tempest and Mrs. Proudie!
What pleasant wrangling goes on in Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Dobbs Broughton’s room over the memorable
picture of Jael, when Dalrymple desires his
model to lean forward, throwing her weight
on the nail, and Miss Van Siever not unnaturally
suggests that such an action would probably
have awakened Sisera before the murder
was done! It all seems idle enough—this careless,
lively talk—but is by no means purposeless.
Life is built up of such moments, and if
we are to live with the people in books, it must
be through little confidences on their parts and
sympathy on ours; it must be through unconscious
confidences on their parts and unrestricted
sympathy on ours.</p>

<p>Now, if a novelist permits his characters to
talk at us, the charm of unconsciousness is gone.
If we feel for a moment they are uttering his
sentiments for our approval or conversion, we
cease to sympathize because we cease to believe.
There is a clever and suspiciously opportune
conversation in <i>David Grieve</i> between
that sorely tried hero and an intelligent workingwoman
in the Champs Elysées upon the
relative merits of l’Union Légale and l’Union<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Libre. It is, of course, a highly dispassionate
discussion, intended as an appeal to reason
and not to conscience; therefore the old-fashioned
arguments of right and wrong, God and
the Church, are carefully omitted. It fits in
neatly with David’s experiences, and places
the whole matter in a singularly lucid light
before the reader’s eyes. Its one serious drawback
is that we can never persuade ourselves
to believe that it ever took place. The Frenchwoman
is brought so suddenly up to the mark;
she says so plainly that which Mrs. Humphry
Ward thinks she ought to say; she is so charmingly
unprejudiced and convincing, that we
lose all faith in her before she has spoken a
dozen words. The correctness of her views
counts for nothing. “When we leave out what
we don’t like, we can demonstrate most things,”
says the late Rector of Lincoln; and it is at
least doubtful whether men and women ever
live virtuous lives on the strength of an argument.
Lady Bertram, of <i>Mansfield Park</i>, remarking
placidly from her sofa, “Do not act
anything improper, my dears; Sir Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
would not like it,” may not exert a powerful
influence for good; but who has any shadow
of doubt that those are her very words? They
are spoken—as they should be—to her daughters,
and not to us. They are spoken—as they
should be—by Lady Bertram, and not by Jane
Austen. Therefore we listen with content, and
take comfort in the thought that, whatever
severities may be inflicted on us by the novelists
of the future, it is not in the power of progress
to deprive us of the past.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_SHORT_DEFENCE_OF_VILLAINS">A SHORT DEFENCE OF VILLAINS</h2>

</div>

<p>Amid the universal grayness that has settled
mistily down upon English fiction,
amid the delicate drab-colored shadings and
half-lights which require, we are told, so fine a
skill in handling, the old-fashioned reader
misses, now and then, the vivid coloring of his
youth. He misses the slow unfolding of quite
impossible plots, the thrilling incidents that
were wont pleasantly to arouse his apprehension,
and, most of all, two characters once
deemed essential to every novel—the hero and
the villain. The heroine is left us still, and her
functions are far more complicated than in the
simple days of yore, when little was required of
her save to be beautiful as the stars. She faces
now the most intricate problems of life; and
she faces them with conscious self-importance,
a dismal power of analysis, and a robust candor
in discussing their equivocal aspects that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
would have sent her buried sister blushing to
the wall. There was sometimes a lamentable
lack of solid virtue in this fair dead sister, a
pitiful human weakness that led to her undoing;
but she never talked so glibly about sin.
As for the hero, he owes his banishment to the
riotous manner in which his masters handled
him. Bulwer strained our endurance and our
credulity to the utmost; Disraeli took a step
further, and Lothair, the last of his race, perished
amid the cruel laughter of mankind.</p>

<p>But the villain! Remember what we owe to
him in the past. Think how dear he has become
to every rightly constituted mind. And
now we are told, soberly and coldly, by the
thin-blooded novelists of the day, that his absence
is one of the crowning triumphs of modern
genius, that we have all grown too discriminating
to tolerate in fiction a character who
we feel does not exist in life. Man, we are reminded,
is complex, subtle, unfathomable,
made up of good and evil so dexterously intermingled
that no one element predominates
coarsely over the rest. He is to be studied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
warily and with misgivings, not classified with
brutal ease into the virtuous and bad. It is
useless to explain to these analysts that the
pleasure we take in meeting a character in a
book does not always depend on our having
known him in the family circle, or encountered
him in our morning paper; though, judged
even by this stringent law, the villain holds his
own. Accept Balzac’s rule, and exclude from
fiction not only all which might not really
happen, but all which has not really happened
in truth, and we would still have studies
enough in total depravity to darken all the
novels in Christendom.</p>

<p>What murder of romance was ever so wanton,
so tragic, and so sombre as that which gave to
the Edinburgh highway the name of Gabriel’s
Road? There, in the sweet summer afternoon,
fresh with the breath of primroses and cowslips,
the young tutor cut the throats of his two
little pupils, in a mad, inexplicable revenge
for their childish tale-bearing. Taken red-handed
in the deed, he met with swift retribution
from the furious populace; and the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
hour which witnessed the crime saw his pinioned
corpse dangling from the nearest tree,
with the bloody knife hung in awful mockery
around its neck. Thus the murder and its
punishment conspired to make the lonely road
a haunted path, ghost-ridden, terrible; where
women shivered and hurried on, and little
boys, creepy with fear, scampered by, breathless,
in the dusk; seeing before them always,
on the ragged turf, two small, piteous, blood-smeared
bodies, and hearing ever, overhead,
the rattle of the rusty knife against the felon’s
bones. The highway, with its unholy associations
discreetly perpetuated in its name, became
an education to the good people of Edinburgh,
and taught them the value of emotions. They
must have indistinctly felt what Mr. Louis Stevenson
has so well described, the subtle harmony
that unites an evil deed to its location.
“Some places,” he says, “speak distinctly.
Certain dark gardens cry aloud for a murder;
certain old houses demand to be haunted; certain
coasts are set apart for shipwreck. Other
spots, again, seem to abide their destiny, suggestive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
and impenetrable.” And is all this fine
and delicate sentiment, all this skillful playing
with horror and fear, to be lost to fiction, merely
because, as De Quincey reluctantly admits,
“the majority of murderers are incorrect characters”?
May we not forgive their general
incorrectness for the sake of their literary and
artistic value? Shall Charles Lamb’s testimony
count for nothing, when we remember his comfortable
allusion to “kind, light-hearted Wainwright”?
And what shall we think of Edward
Fitzgerald, the gentlest and least hurtful of
Englishmen, abandoning himself, in the clear
and genial weather, to the delights of Tacitus,
“full of pleasant atrocity”?</p>

<p>Repentant villains, I must confess, are not
greatly to my mind. They sacrifice their artistic
to their ethical value, and must be handled
with consummate skill to escape a suspicious
flavor of Sunday-school romance. The hardened
criminal, disarmed and converted by the
innocent attractions of childhood, is a favorite
device of poets and story-writers who cater to
the sentiments of maternity; but it is wiser to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
lay no stress upon the permanency of such
conversions. That swift and sudden yielding
to a gentle emotion or a noble aspiration,
which is one of the undying traits of humanity,
attracts us often by the very force of its evanescence,
by the limitations which prove its
truth. But the slow, stern process of regeneration
is not an emotional matter, and cannot
be convincingly portrayed with a few facile
touches in the last chapter of a novel. Thackeray
knew better than this, when he showed us
Becky Sharp touched and softened by her good
little sister-in-law; heartsick now and then of
her own troublesome schemes, yet sinking inevitably
lower and lower through the weight
of overmastering instincts and desires. She
can aspire intermittingly to a cleaner life, but
she can never hope to reach it. The simple literature
of the past is curiously rich in these pathetic
transient glimpses into fallen nature’s
brighter side. Where can we see depicted with
more tenderness and truth the fitful relenting
of man’s brutality, after it has wrought the ruin
it devised, than in the fine old ballad of <i>Edom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
O’Gordon</i>? The young daughter of the house
of Rodes is lowered from the walls of the burning
castle, and the cruel Gordon spears transfix
her as she falls. She lies dead, in her
budding girlhood, at the feet of her father’s foe,
and his heart is strangely stirred and troubled
when he looks at her childish face.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is pleasant to know that the ruthless butcher
was promptly pursued and slain for his crime,
but it is finer still to realize that brief moment
of bitterness and shame. I have sometimes
thought that Rossetti’s Sister Helen would
have gained in artistic beauty if, after those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
three days of awful watching were over, after
the glowing fragment of wax had melted
in the flames, and her lover’s soul had passed
her, sighing on the wind, there had come to
the stricken girl a pang of supreme regret, an
impulse of mad desire to undo the horror she
had wrought. The conscience of a sinner, to
use a striking phrase of Mr. Brownell’s, “is
doubtless readjusted rather than repudiated
altogether,” and there is an absolute truthfulness
in these sudden relapses into grace.</p>

<p>For this reason, doubtless, I find Mr. Blackmore’s
villains, with all their fascination and
power, a shade too heavily, or at least too
monotonously darkened. Parson Chowne is a
veritable devil, and it is only his occasional
humor—manifested grimly in deeds, not words—which
enables us to bear the weight of his
insupportable wickedness. The introduction
of the naked savages as an outrage to village
propriety; the summons to church, when he
has a mind to fire the ricks of his parishioners,—these
are the life-giving touches which mellow
down this overwrought figure, this black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
and scowling thunderbolt of humanity. Perhaps,
also, Mr. Blackmore, in his laudable desire
for picturesqueness, lays too much stress
on the malignant aspect, the appropriate physical
condition of his sinners. From Parson
Chowne’s “wondrous unfathomable face,”
which chills every heart with terror, to the
“red glare” in Donovan Bulrag’s eyes, there
is always something exceptional about these
worthies, to indicate to all beholders what
manner of men they are. One is reminded
of Charles II. protesting, not unnaturally,
against the perpetual swarthiness of stage villains.
“We never see a rogue in a play but
we clap on him a black periwig,” complained
the dark-skinned monarch, with a sense of
personal grievance in this forced association
between complexion and crime. It was the
same subtle inspiration which prompted Kean
to play Shylock in a red wig that suggested
to Wilkie Collins Count Fosco’s admirable
size. The passion for embroidered waistcoats
and fruit tarts, the petted white mice, the sympathetic
gift of pastry to the organ-grinder’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
monkey, all the little touches which go to
build up this colossal, tender-hearted, remorseless,
irresistible scoundrel are of interest and
value to the portrait, but his fat is as essential
as his knavery. It is one of those master
strokes of genius which breaks away from all
accepted traditions to build up a new type,
perfect and unapproachable. We can no
more imagine a thin Fosco than a melancholy
Dick Swiveller, or a light-hearted Ravenswood.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Lang, who enjoys upon all occasions
the courage of his convictions, has, in
one of those pleasant papers, “At the Sign of
the Ship,” given utterance to a sentiment so
shockingly at variance with the prevalent theory
of fiction, that the reader is divided between
admiration for his boldness and a vague
surprise that a man should speak such words
and live. There is a cheerfulness, too, about
Mr. Lang’s heterodoxy, a smiling ignorance of
his own transgression, that warms our hearts
and weakens our upbraiding. “The old simple
scheme,” he says, “in which you had a real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
unmitigated villain, a heroine as pure as snow
or flame, and a crowd of good ordinary people,
gave us more agreeable reading, and reading
not, I think, more remote from truth, than is to
be found in Dr. Ibsen’s <i>Ghosts</i> or in his <i>Pillars
of Society</i>.” Now to support such a statement
would be unscrupulous; to condemn it, dispiriting;
but I wonder if the “real unmitigated villain”
is quite so simple a product as Mr. Lang
appears to imagine. May not his absence from
literature be owing as much to the limitations
as to the disregard of modern realists? Is he,
in truth, so easily drawn as to be unworthy of
their subtle and discriminating pens? Is Sir
Giles Overreach a mere child’s toy in comparison
with Consul Bernick, and is Brian de Bois-Guilbert
unworthy to rank with Johann Tönnesen
and Oswald Alving? A villain must be a
thing of power, handled with delicacy and
grace. He must be wicked enough to excite
our aversion, strong enough to arouse our fear,
human enough to awaken some transient
gleam of sympathy. We must triumph in his
downfall, yet not barbarously nor with contempt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
and the close of his career must be in
harmony with all its previous development.
Mrs. Pennell has told us the story of some old
Venetian witches, who were converted from
their dark ways, and taught the charms of
peace and godliness; but who would desire or
credit the conversion of a witch? The potency
of evil lies within her to the end; and when,
by a few muttered words, she can raise a hell
storm on the ocean; when her eye’s dim fire
can wither the strength of her enemy; or
when, with a lock of hair and a bit of wax, she
can consume him with torturing pain, who
will welcome her neighborly advances? The
proper and artistic end of a witch is at the
stake—blue flames curling up to heaven, and
a handful of gray ashes scattered to the wind;
or, by the working of a stronger spell, she
may be stiffened into stone, and doomed to
stand forever on some desolate moor, where,
underneath starless skies, her evil feet have
strayed; or perhaps that huge black cat, her
sinister attendant, has completed his ninth
year of servitude to nine successive witches,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
and, by virtue of the power granted him at
their expiration, he may whisk her off bodily
on St. John’s Eve, to offer her a living holocaust
to Satan. These are possibilities in strict
sympathy with her character and history, if
not with her inclinations; the last is in especial
accordance with sound Italian tradition,
and all reveal what Heine calls “the melancholy
pleasurable awe, the dark sweet horror,
of Mediæval ghost fancies.” But a converted
witch, walking demurely to vesper service,
gossiping with good, garrulous old women on
the doorstep, or holding an innocent child
within her withered arms—the very thought
repels us instinctively, and fires us with a
sharp mistrust. Have a care, you foolish
young mother, and snatch your baby to your
breast; for even now he waxes paler and paler,
as those cold, malignant heart-throbs chill his
breath, and wear his little life away.</p>

<p>The final disposition of a mere earthly villain
should likewise be a matter of artistic necessity,
not a harsh trampling of arrogant virtue
upon prostrate vice. There is no mistake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
so fatal as that of injustice to the evil element
of a novel or a play. We all know how, when
Portia pushes her triumphant casuistry a step
too far, our sympathies veer obstinately
around to Shylock’s side, and refuse to be readjusted
before the curtain falls. Perhaps
Shakespeare intended this,—who knows?—and
threw in Gratiano’s last jeers to madden,
not the usurer, but the audience. Or perhaps
in Elizabeth’s day, as in King John’s, people
had not grown so finical about the feelings of
a Jew, and it is only the chilly tolerance of
our enlightened age which prevents our enjoying
as we should the devout prejudices of our
ancestors. But when, in a modern novel,
guiltless of all this picturesque superstition,
we see the sinner treated with a narrow, nagging
sort of severity, our unregenerate nature
rebels stoutly against such a manifest lack of
balance. Not long ago, I chanced to read a
story which actually dared to have a villain for
a hero, and I promised myself much pleasure
from so original and venturesome a step. But
how did the very popular authoress treat her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
own creation? In the first place, when rescued
from a truly feminine haze of hints, and
dark whispers, and unsubstantiated innuendoes,
the hapless man is proven guilty of but three
offences: he takes opium, he ejects his tenants,
and he tries, not very successfully, to mesmerize
his wife. Now, opium-eating is a vice, the
punishment for which is borne by the offender,
and which merits as much pity as contempt;
rack-renting is an unpardonable, but not at all
a thrilling misdemeanor; and, in these days of
psychological research, there are many excellent
men who would not shrink from making
hypnotic experiments on their grandmothers.
In consequence, however, of such feeble atrocities,
the hero-villain is subjected to a species
of outlawry at the hands of all the good people
in the book. His virtuous cousin makes open
and highly honorable love to his virtuous wife,
who responds with hearty alacrity. His virtuous
cousin’s still more virtuous brother comes
within an ace of murdering him in cold blood,
through motives of the purest philanthropy.
Finally, one of these virtuous young men lets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
loose on him his family ghost, deliberately unsealing
the spectral abiding-place; and, while
the virtuous wife clings around the virtuous
cousin’s neck, and forbids him tenderly to go
to the rescue, the accommodating spirit—who
seems to have no sort of loyalty to the connection—slays
the villain at his own doorstep,
and leaves the coast free for a second marriage
service. Practically, the device is an admirable
one, because, when the ghost retires once
more to his seclusion, nobody can well be
convicted of manslaughter, and a great deal of
scandal is saved. But, artistically, there is
something repellent in this open and shameless
persecution; in three persons and a hobgoblin
conspiring against one poor man. Our
sentiment is diverted from its proper channel,
our emotions are manifestly incorrect.</p>

<p>“How are you to get up the sympathies of
the audience in a legitimate manner,” asks Mr.
Vincent Crummles, “if there isn’t a little man
contending against a big one?—unless there’s
at least five to one, and we haven’t hands
enough for that business in our company.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
What would the noble-hearted Mr. Crummles
have thought of reversing this natural order of
things, and declaring victory for the multitude?
How would human nature, in the provinces,
have supported so novel and hazardous an innovation?
Why should human nature, out of
the provinces, be assumed to have outgrown
its simple, chivalrous instincts? A good,
strong, designing, despicable villain, or even
villainess, a fair start, a stout fight, an artistic
overthrow, and triumphant Virtue smiling
modestly beneath her orange blossoms—shall
we ever be too old and world-worn to love
these old and world-worn things?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_BY-WAY_IN_FICTION">A BY-WAY IN FICTION</h2>

</div>

<p>Now and then the wearied and worn
novel-reader, sick unto death of books
about people’s beliefs and disbeliefs, their conscientious
scruples and prejudices, their unique
aspirations and misgivings, their cumbersome
vices and virtues, is recompensed for much suffering
by an hour of placid but genuine enjoyment.
He picks up rather dubiously a little,
unknown volume, and, behold! the writer
thereof takes him gently by the hand, and leads
him straightway into a fair country, where the
sun is shining, and men and women smile
kindly on him, and nobody talks unorthodox
theology, and everybody seems disposed to
allow everybody else the privilege of being
nappy in his own way. When to these admirable
qualities are added humor and an atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
of appreciative cultivation, the novel-reader
feels indeed that his lines have been
cast in pleasant places, and he is disposed to
linger along in a very contented and uncritical
frame of mind.</p>

<p>There has come to us recently a new and
beautiful edition of such a little book, published
in America, but born of Italian soil and
sunshine. It has for a title <i>The Chevalier of
Pensieri-Vani, together with Frequent Allusions
to the Prorege of Arcopia</i>, which, is rather
an unmerciful string of words to describe so
gay and easy-going a narrative. It is the first
full-fledged literary venture of its author, Mr.
Henry Fuller, also known as Stanton Page,
whose New England grandfather was a cousin
of Margaret Fuller’s. The story, which is not
really a story at all, but a series of detached
episodes, rambles backward and forward in
such a bewildering fashion that the chapters
might be all rearranged without materially disturbing
its slender thread of continuity. It is
equally guiltless of plot or purpose, of dramatic
incidents or realistic details. The Chevalier may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
be found now in Pisa, now in Venice, now in
Ostia or Ravenna, never driven by the vulgar
spur of necessity, always wandering of his
own free and idle will. He is accompanied
sometimes by his friend Hors-Concours, an
Italianized Frenchman from Savoy, and sometimes
by the Prorege of Arcopia, the delightful
Prorege, who gives to the book its best and
most distinctive flavor. At once dignified and
urbane, conscious of his exalted position, and
convinced that he fills it with equal grace and
correctness, this superb official moves through
the tale in an atmosphere of autocratic reserve,
tempered with the most delicate courtesy.
His ministerial views are as unalterable as the
rocks, and as sound; but he listens to the
democratic ravings of his young American
<i>protégé</i>, Occident, with the good-humored indulgence
one accords to a beloved and precocious
child. It must be confessed that Occident
fails to make his arguments very convincing,
or to impress his own personality with any degree
of clearness upon the reader’s mind. He
is at best only a convenient listener to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Prorege’s delicious theories; he is of real value
only because the Prorege condescends to talk
to him. When he ventures upon a truly
American remark about trying “to find the
time” for something, his august friend reminds
him, with dignity, that “the only man to be
envied was the man whose time was in some
degree his own, and the most pitiable object
that civilization could offer was the rich man a
slave to his chronometer. Too much had been
said about the dignity of labor, and not enough
about the preciousness of leisure. Civilization
in its last outcome was heavily in the debt of
leisure, and the success of any society worth
considering was to be estimated largely by the
use to which its <i>fortunati</i> had put their spare
moments. He wrung from Occident the confession
that, in the great land of which Shelby
County may be called the centre, activity, considered
of itself and quite apart from its objects
and its results, was regarded as a very meritorious
thing; and he learned that the bare figure
of leisure, when exposed to the public gaze, was
expected to be decorously draped in the garment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
of strenuous endeavor. People were
supposed to appear busy, even if they were
not. This gave the Prorege a text for a little
disquisition on the difference between leisure
and idleness.”</p>

<p>In fact, a beautiful, cultivated, polished, unmarred,
well-spent inactivity is the keynote of
this serene little book; and to understand its
charm and meaning we have but to follow the
Chevalier, in the second chapter, to Pisa—to
Pisa the restful, where “life is not strongly accentuated
by positive happenings, where incident
is unusual, and drama quite unknown.”
The Chevalier’s windows, we are told, faced the
north, and he sat and looked out of them rather
more than active persons would deem pleasant
or profitable. It even happened that the
Prorege remarked this comfortable habit, and
demanded of his friend what it was he looked
at, inasmuch as there seemed to be no appreciable
change from day to day. To which the
Chevalier, in whom “Quietism was pretty successfully
secularized; who knew how to sit still,
and occasionally enjoyed doing so,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
with great acumen that what <i>had</i> gone on was
quite as interesting to him as what was going
on, and that nothing was more gratifying, from
his point of view, than that very absence of
change which had taken his Excellency’s attention—since
any change would be a change
for the worse.</p>

<p>He is destined, as it chances, to prove the
truth of his own theories, for it is in Pisa, of all
places, that he is tempted to throw aside for
once his <i>rôle</i> of contemplative philosopher, and
to assume that of an active philanthropist, with
very disastrous results. There is an admirable
satire in the description of the two friends,
Pensieri-Vani and Hors-Concours, gravely
plotting to insure the success of an operatic
<i>débutante</i>, to bring her out in the sunshine of
their generous patronage, and with the direct
approval of the Prorege himself, who kindly
consents to sit in the front of a middle box, and
to wear a round half-dozen of his most esteemed
decorations. Unhappily, an Italian audience
does not like to have its enthusiasm expressed
for it, even by such noble and consummate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
critics. As each well-arranged device of flowers
or love-birds in a gilded cage is handed
decorously forward, the house grows colder
and more quizzical, until the <i>débutante</i> sees
herself on the extreme verge of failure, and,
putting forth all her powers in one appealing
effort, she triumphs by dint of sheer pluck and
ability over the fatal kindness of her friends.
The poor Chevalier, who has in the meantime
left the theatre with many bitter self-communings,
receives his lesson in a spirit of touching
humility, recognizing at once his manifest limitations.
“He perceived that he was less fitted
to play the part of special providence than he
had previously supposed; and he brought from
this experience the immeasurable consolation
that comes from knowing that very frequently
in this sadly twisted world, things, if only left
to their own courses, have a way of coming out
right in the end.”</p>

<p>The Pisan episode, the delicious journey of
the Prorege and Pensieri-Vani in search of
the “Madonna Incognita,” a mysterious and
illusive Perugino which turns out, after all, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
be a Sodoma, and the memorable excursion to
Ostia, are the finest and best-told incidents in
the book. The story of the Iron Pot is too
broadly farcical, too Pickwickian in its character,
to be in harmony with the rest of the
narrative; the Contessa’s fête at Tusculum is
so lightly sketched as to be absolutely tantalizing;
and the practical jokes which that lady
and the Prorege delight in playing upon one
another are hardly as subtle and acute as we
would like to find them. Indeed, the Prorege’s
conduct on board his own yacht is so deeply
objectionable that I, for one, positively refuse
to believe he was ever guilty of such raw rudeness.
It is not kind or right in Mr. Fuller to
wickedly calumniate this charming and high-bred
gentleman whom he has given us for a
friend. Neither is the battle of the Aldines as
thrilling as might be expected, probably because
it is impossible to accept the Duke of
Avon and Severn upon any terms whatever.
Occident, the American, is misty and ill-defined;
but he does not lack proportion, only
vitality. The English duke is a mistake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
throughout, a false note that disturbs the atmosphere
of serene good temper which is the
principal attraction of the book; an effort on
the author’s part to be severe and cynical, just
when we were congratulating ourselves that
severity and cynicism were things far, far remote
from his tolerant and kindly spirit.</p>

<p>The excursion to Ostia, however, is enough
to redeem the whole volume from any charge
of ill-nature; for if the Contessa does seize this
opportunity to play one of her dubious tricks
upon the Prorege, it is not until the little group
of friends have proved themselves gentle, and
sympathetic, and full of fine and generous instincts.
It is a delicious bit of description
throughout. La Nullaniuna has been crowned
the day before at her Tusculum fête as “the
new Corinne,” and naturally feels that her proper
cue is that of “genius-blasted fragility,”
overpowered and shattered by her own impassioned
burst of song. With her is the widowed
Princess Altissimi, her cherished friend and
foil, a sombre beauty of a grave and chastened
demeanor, against whose dark background the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Contessa, “who was fully as flighty, and capricious,
and <i>théâtrale</i> as a woman of semi-genius
usually finds it necessary to be, posed
and fidgeted to her heart’s content.” The Prorege,
sublimely affable as ever, Pensieri-Vani,
and young Occident, eager and radiant, make
up the party; and after the little inn has furnished
them with a noonday meal of unusual
profusion and elegance, they visit the adjoining
church at the instigation of the Princess Altissimi,
who is anxious to see what this solitary
and humble temple is like. All that follows is
so exquisite that I must quote it as it stands,
in proof of the author’s faculty for delicate and
sympathetic delineation:</p>

<p>“They were met on the threshold by the
single priest in charge, a dark and sallow
young man of peasant extraction, whose lonely
battle with midsummer malaria had left him
wholly gaunt and enervate. He saluted them
with the deference which the Church sometimes
shows to the World, though he was too
true an Italian to be awed, or even embarrassed
by their rank; and he brightened up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
into something almost like eagerness as he offered
to do the honors of his charge. The
Prorege indulgently praised the wretched frescoes
which he exhibited so proudly, and the
Contessa called up a flickering smile of pleasure
in his emaciated face as she feigned an enthusiasm
for the paltry fripperies of the high
altar. This appreciative interest emboldened
him to suggest their ascent to the gallery,
where, from his manner, the great treasure of
the church was to be revealed. The great
treasure was a small cabinet organ, and Occident—triumphing
in the ubiquity of the Western
genius, yet somewhat taken back by this
new illustration of the incongruities it sometimes
precipitated—read upon it a name familiar
to his earliest years. The priest, who evidently
conceived it an impossibility for his
beloved instrument to be guilty of a discord of
any kind whatever, pleaded with a mute but
unmistakable pathos that its long silence might
now be ended; and the Princess, motioning
Pensieri-Vani to the keyboard, sang this poor
solitary a churchly little air, with such a noble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
seriousness and such a gracious simplicity as
to move, not only him, but all the others too.
Occident, in particular, who kept within him
quite unimpaired his full share of that fund of
sensibility which is one of the best products of
Shelby County, and who would have given
half his millions just then to have been able to
sit down and play the simplest tune, implored
Pensieri-Vani in looks, if not in words, to do
for him what he himself was so powerless to
compass; and the Cavaliere, who, like a good
and true musician, preferred support from the
lowest quarter to indifference in the highest,
kept his place until their poor host, charmed,
warmed through and through, attached again
to the great body of humanity, could scarcely
trust himself to voice his thanks. But the
Princess whispered in the Cavaliere’s ear, as
his series of plain and simple little tunes came
to an end, that he had not lost since she last
heard him.”</p>

<p>There is nothing finer in the story than this,
perhaps nothing quite so good, though all of
Pensieri-Vani’s journeys are fruitful in minute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
incidents of a pleasant and picturesque quality.
It is curious, too, to see how the Chevalier,
who, except for that catlike scratching about
the Aldines, is the gentlest and least hurtful
of men, manifests at times a positive impatience
of his own refined and peaceful civilization, a
breathless envy of sterner races and of stormier
days. When he discovers the tomb of the old
Etrurian warrior, he is abashed and humbled
at the thought of that fierce spirit summoned
from thirty centuries of darkness to see the
light of this invertebrate and sentimental age;
requested to forget his deep draughts of blood
and iron, and to contentedly “munch the
dipped toast of a flabby humanitarianism, and
sip the weak tea of brotherly love.” When he
stands in the dim cathedral of Anagni, and
contemplates the tombs of the illustrious Gaetani
family, and the mosaics which blazon forth
their former splendors, he shrinks with sudden
shame from the contrast between his feeble,
forceless will and the rough daring of that
mighty clan. “The stippling technique of his
own day seemed immeasurably poor and paltry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
compared with the broad, free, sketchy touch
with which these men dashed off their stirring
lives; and he stood confounded before that fiery
and robust intensity which, so gloriously indifferent
to the subtilties of the grammarian,
the niceties of the manicure, and the torments
of the supersensitive self-analyst, could fix its
intent upon some definite desire, and move forward
unswervingly to its attainment. Poor
moderns! he sighed, who with all our wishing
never reach our end, and with all our thinking
never know what we really think.”</p>

<p>These unprofitable musings of the Chevalier’s
seem to reflect some recurring discontent, some
restless, unchastened yearnings on the part of
the author himself; but they find no echo in the
serene breast of the Prorege. He at least is as
remote from envying the hostilities of the past
as he is innocent of aspiring to the progressiveness
of the future. He is fully alive to the
merits of his own thrice-favored land, where
the evil devices of a wrong-headed generation
have never been suffered to penetrate: “Arcopia,
the gods be praised, was exempt from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
modern curse of bigness. One chimney was
not offensive; but a million made a London.
One refuse-heap could be tolerated; but accumulated
thousands produced a New York. A
hundred weavers in their own cottages meant
peaceful industry and home content; a hundred
hundred, massed in one great factory, meant
vice and squalor and disorder. Society had
never courted failure or bid for misery more ardently
than when it had accepted an urban industrialism
for a basis.... Happily the
Arcopian population, except a fraction that followed
the arts and another fraction that followed
the sea, was largely agricultural, and exhibited
in high union the chief virtue and the
chief grace of civilized society—order and picturesqueness.
The disturbing and ungracious
catch-word, ‘Égalité,’ had never crossed the
Arcopian sea; if the Prorege had not been tolerably
sure that his mild sway was to be undisturbed
by the clangor of cantankerous boiler-makers
and the bickerings of a bumptious,
shopkeeping <i>bourgeoisie</i>, he would never have
undertaken the task at all. He regarded himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
as a just, humane, and sympathetic ruler, but
he believed that every man should have his
own proper place and fill it.”</p>

<p>Such are the views smilingly detailed to the
puzzled and outraged Occident, who, having
been nourished in boyhood on the discourses of
rustic theologians, and the forensics of Shelbyville
advocates, finds it difficult to assimilate
his own theories of life with a civilization he
so imperfectly understands. He doubts his
ability to take the European attitude, he doubts
the propriety of the attitude when taken, and
the struggle ends in the usual manner by his
marrying a wife, and going back to Shelby
County to be a good citizen for the rest of his
days. Hors-Concours, mindful of the duties
entailed on the proprietor of a small patrimony
and an ancient name, espouses with becoming
gravity and deliberation the Princess Altissimi.
The Prorege retires to Arcopia the
blessed, whither we would fain follow him if
we could; and Pensieri-Vani, left desolate and
alone, consoles himself with the reflection that
life has many sides, and that Italy has not yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
given up to him all she has to give: “Others
might falter; but he was still sufficient unto
himself, still master of his own time and his
own actions, and enamored only of that delightful
land whose beauty age cannot wither,
and whose infinite variety custom can never
stale.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COMEDY_OF_THE_CUSTOM_HOUSE">COMEDY OF THE CUSTOM HOUSE</h2>

</div>

<p>There is no place in the world where human
nature is so thoroughly human or
so purely natural as on the New York docks,
when a great steamer load of returning travelers
are being put through the <i>peine forte et
dure</i> of the United States custom house.
Everybody is striving to play a part, to assume
an air of indifference which he does not feel,
and of innocence which he knows to be fallacious;
and, like Mrs. Browning’s Masker,
everybody betrays too plainly in his “smiling
face” and “jesting bold” the anxiety that
preys upon his vitals. Packed snugly away in
that wilderness of trunks and boxes are hundreds,
nay, thousands, of pretty trifles, which
it is the painful duty of every man, and the
proud ambition of every woman, to carry in
unscathed and undetected. The frank, shameless
delight which a woman takes in smuggling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
has long puzzled the male moralist, who, following
the intricacies of the feminine conscience,
can find no satisfactory explanation
of this by-path. He cannot bring her to
understand why, when she has purchased and
paid for an article, it should not be hers to
take where she likes, to deal with as she
pleases; and a dozen discourses on political
economy and the laws of nations leave her unshaken
in this simple and primitive conception.
As the English are said to argue best in platoons,
so a woman argues best in action; and,
while her husband or brother is proving to her
in the clearest possible fashion that a high protective
tariff is a blessing to the land, she is
assiduously storing away embroidered table
covers, and silk stockings, and silver spoons,
and tortoise-shell combs, and tiny jeweled
pins, and bits of frail Venetian glass, wherever
her practiced eye tells her they will best escape
detection. In the abstract, of course, dear
Edwin is right—he always is—but she is far
too busy with her task to enter into abstractions
just now. Whatever mental subtlety she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
possesses is reserved for a much more important
ordeal—that of getting clear, with a clean
conscience, from the searching questions of the
inspector. “When I am asked if I have any
presents I always answer no,” said a devout,
church-going woman to me one day, “because
I do not consider them presents until I
give them away.”</p>

<p>The grim, perplexed seriousness with which
the customs officers play their part makes a
delightful foil (for the spectators) to the nimble,
elusive mental movements of their adversaries;
and it is in the conflict between aggressor
and aggrieved, between invader and invaded,
that the humors of our great national institution
develop their choicest bloom. The fortunes
of war which recently delayed my own
boxes and my hoped-for escape, gave me, by
way of compensation, an easy opportunity of
observing and enjoying the experiences of
other people, and I was encouraged in my diversion
by the too evident glee of one of the
minor actors in the strife. She was a very
pretty girl, this gay young combatant, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
more than sixteen years old, and she sat kicking
her heels on somebody else’s trunk, while
she watched with enviable composure the overhauling
of her own. I had seen her often during
the homeward voyage, and had spoken to
her once or twice as she tripped endlessly up
and down the deck in company with every man
and boy on board; taking them impartially,
one by one, and seeming to be on the same
mysterious terms of intimacy with all. She
had a traveling companion in the shape of a
mother who adored her fretfully, and whom she
treated with finely mingled affection and contempt.
She never spoke of this relative without
the prefix “poor.” “Poor mother is awfully
sick to-day,” she would say in her shrill,
high-pitched voice, with a laugh which showed
all her little white teeth, and sounded a trifle
unsympathetic in our ears. But five minutes
later she was helping “poor mother” to her
steamer chair, wrapping her up skilfully in
half a dozen rugs and shawls, bullying the deck
steward to bring her some hot bouillon, bullying
her to drink the bouillon when brought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
listening to her manifold complaints with an
indulgent smile, and flatly refusing to obey,
when entreated to put on a warmer jacket.</p>

<p>“Poor mother is always worrying about
wraps,” was her only acknowledgment of the
maternal solicitude; and even this remark was
made, not to her prostrate parent, but to the
youth who was waiting to bear her away.</p>

<p>The pair had been traveling alone all summer,
but were met on the docks by a person
whom they both called “cousin Jim,” and who
assured them in a hearty, offhand manner that
he would have them safe through the custom
house in five minutes; a miscalculation, as it
turned out, of quite three-quarters of an hour.
Malignant fate assigned them an inspector who
settled down to his search like an Indian to
the war trail, and who seemed possessed with
the idea that the wealth of the Indies lay secreted
somewhere in those two shabby, travel-worn
boxes. Whether this man was really
enamored of his disagreeable task, whether
he conscientiously believed that the United
States would be impoverished and her industries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
crippled by the contents of that modest
luggage, or whether he had been too pliable
on former occasions, and seized this chance to
assert his general incorruptibility, it would be
hard to determine; but while older and less
ardent officials lifted out trays and turned over
corners in a purely perfunctory manner, seeing
nothing, and seeking to see nothing of what
lay beneath, this red-hot zealot went thoroughly
and exhaustively to work upon the limited
materials before him. Now the particular irritation
of the custom house lies, not in the fact
of your trunk being searched, but of your neighbor’s
trunk escaping; and the sharpest sting is
when you chance to know that your neighbor
is carrying in unmolested ten times the value
of your dutiable articles. If Miss Maisie, kicking
her heels and smiling affably, did not realize
the hardship of her position, Miss Maisie’s
mother—she never had any other name,
her sole claim to distinction resting on her
daughter—felt it very keenly. She stood,
anxious and angry, by the side of the inspector,
protesting fretfully at each new in-road,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
and appealing for sympathy to her companions.</p>

<p>“It’s a perfect shame, the way he has rumpled
your dresses, Maisie, and upset that tray
you packed so nice and close. You will never
be able to get the things back again in the
world, and, if you do, one half of them will be
broken before we reach home. And there’s
your new fur cape all out of fold. I told you
to wear it, or carry it in on your arm. No!
that is not a present; at least I think not, is it,
Maisie?” as a small brown paper parcel, carefully
tied, was held up by the inspector for
scrutiny.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell till I open it,” said the girl,
reaching over, and very deliberately unfastening
the string. “You don’t remember what
this is, do you, mother? Oh! I see—a piece
of camphor. No, it’s not a present. We
brought it from America. Lasts beautifully,
doesn’t it?” returning the parcel with a smile.
“Would you mind wrapping it up again? It’s
so very hard to tie anything in gloves.”</p>

<p>Apparently the inspector did mind, for he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
jerked the lump of camphor unwrapped into
the trunk, and made a vicious scoop among
the layers of neatly packed clothing. “Is this
a present, then?” he asked, drawing to light a
flat oblong white box, and snapping the cord
that bound it. Inside, resting on pink cotton
wool, was a small silver-backed hand-mirror of
fine workmanship. “Surely this must be a present?”
he repeated, with the triumphant air of
one who has dragged a secret crime to justice.</p>

<p>Maisie’s mother looked nervous, and fidgeted
visibly, but Maisie herself was imperturbable.
“You are mistaken; it is not,” she said, without
a tremor.</p>

<p>The man glanced at her sharply, and
shrugged his shoulders. “You keep it very
nicely put away for an article in use,” he hinted,
turning over the box once or twice with
manifest doubt and reluctance. “And these—are
all these your own, too?” unearthing from
some secret receptacle six little card-cases of
blue leather, and spreading them out jeeringly
in a row.</p>

<p>“I told you not to get so many, Maisie, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
you would do it,” said her mother, in the hopeless
tone of a convicted criminal.</p>

<p>“They were such bargains, I couldn’t resist
them,” answered the girl sorrowfully. “Yes,
they are presents; at least five of them are. I
guess I will keep one for myself, and save that,
any way. Just put one of them back, please.
And oh, dear! do you have to lift out that
heavy tray? There are nothing but clothes at
the bottom of the trunk.”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all but clothes,” interposed her
mother peevishly. “I don’t see why you have
to go through everything in this fashion.”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all but clothes,” repeated cousin
Jim, who had hitherto stood staring silently
at the confusion before him. “Can’t you take
the ladies’ word for it, when they assure you
there is nothing underneath but clothes?”</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” said the inspector, exasperated
into insolence, “I should be very glad to
take any lady’s word, but I can’t. I’ve learned
a great deal better.”</p>

<p>Maisie’s mother colored hotly, with the righteous
indignation of a woman who lies easily,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
and is accused of falsehood; but Maisie, screwing
her pretty head on one side, winked at
me in shameless enjoyment of the situation.
“He’ll find I’m right this time,” she whispered;
“but wasn’t it lucky he got it into his stupid
brain that the glass must be a present! If he
had said ‘commission’ now, I should have
been caught, and the friend I bought it for
would be simply furious if I had to pay duty on
it. Poor mother insisted that I should not
take a single commission this summer, so I
only have very few; just that glass, and some
gloves, of course, and a feather collar, and half
a dozen pairs of stockings, and a little silk
shawl from Rome. One girl did ask me to buy
her a dress in Paris, but I wouldn’t do it; and
another wanted a pair of blue slippers, but fortunately
I forgot her size; and another—”</p>

<p>“Maisie, dear, do put back your things now,”
interrupted her unhappy parent, who by this
time was on the verge of tears. “The inspector
has finished with your trunk, and is going
to mine. And please be careful of your cape!
I wish you had worn it instead—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>“Instead of my old one?” said the girl hastily,
smoothing down, as she spoke, a very
handsome and palpably new piece of sealskin
on her shoulders. “Poor mother is so blundering,”
she sighed softly in my ear. “I am
wearing this cape for Dr. Hunsdale. He is
bringing it home to his sister, and of course
wouldn’t have any shadow of a chance with it
himself. Indeed, he intended to declare it,
which would have been a dreadful shame. So
I just offered to pack mine and wear this one.
Lots of girls do, you know. I’ve got a watch
here for another man, too,” lightly touching
the châtelaine by her side. “Not a gold one.
Only a little silver thing he bought for <i>his</i> sister,
who is a child. Poor mother doesn’t know
about that, or she would be more miserable
still; and she is pretty miserable now, isn’t
she?” contemplating her perturbed relative
with gentle disfavor. “You see, she worries
so, she makes that man believe we have something
tremendously valuable somewhere, and
he is bent on finding it out. There, he’s after
our Roman blankets; but those are for ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
and, what is more,” raising her voice, “we
have had them in use for nearly three months.”</p>

<p>“Three months isn’t long enough,” returned
the official surlily. “You must have had them
in use a year, to bring them in free.”</p>

<p>“A year!” echoed Maisie, opening her round
eyes with innocent amazement. “If you knew
much about Roman blankets, you wouldn’t expect
anybody to use them for a year, and then
think them worth bringing home. What a thrifty
lot the custom-house people must be! Poor
mother! She never expected to pay for those,
and it does seem a little hard on her. But
what’s that he’s got now? Oh! <i>do</i> look!” for
the inspector had grabbed something loosely
wrapped in white tissue paper, and was holding
it aloft with an exultant shake, and an
“I’ve-tracked-you-at-last” expression. Down
fell a rubber shoe, of unmistakable American
manufacture, but richly crusted with layers of
foreign mud. It flopped modestly into the bottom
of the trunk, and was greeted with a ringing
laugh of genuine, uncontrolled delight.
“That’s a present,” sobbed the girl, literally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
choking with mirth, “and very valuable. We
brought it from the South Kensington, and are
going to send it to the Metropolitan Museum
as soon as we reach home.”</p>

<p>“Maisie, how can you be so foolish!” protested
her mother, roused by desperation to
some faint semblance of authority, and visibly
anxious to propitiate the inspector, who looked
ominously angry. “If you will wrap such absurd
things in white tissue paper, naturally
people think they are of some value.”</p>

<p>“But we had so much tissue paper in London,
and nothing else to wrap with,” was the
very reasonable reply. “Fifteen sheets the
tailor sent home with my one frock, and I am
keeping most of it to use at Christmas time.
Poor old shoe!” lifting it tenderly out of the
trunk; “if mud were a dutiable article—and I
only wonder it isn’t—you would come very
expensive just now. Swiss mud, too, I do believe,
never brushed off since that day at Grindelwald,
and quite a relic. Don’t you think,”
turning suddenly to me, “don’t you really
think all this is fearfully funny?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>In one sense I did, though the fun was of a
strictly esoteric character, not appealing broadly
to the crowd. But then Mr. Saintsbury assures
us that real fun seldom does. Poor mother’s
sense of humor was plainly unequal to
the demand made upon it; cousin Jim, who
had not spoken since his first repulse, looked
more bewildered than amused; and even the
inspector did not seem vastly entertained by
the situation. The trunks had been examined,
and their contents sadly disarranged; the
handbags searched, and found to contain only
toilet articles and underwear; the steamer rugs,
unrolled, revealed nothing more precious than
an old magazine and four battered French
novels. As a result of over half an hour’s inquisition,
the authorities had possessed themselves
of two well-worn Roman blankets, a
pretty, inexpensive little fan, painted on brown
linen, a beer mug of Munich ware, and those
five blue card-cases that had been so cheap in
Paris. It hardly seemed as if the spoils were
worth the conflict, or as if the three dollars and
ninety cents duty charged on them could be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
serious addition to the revenues of the United
States. But the home-coming of one poor
woman had been marred, and no salt-tax of
ancient France was ever paid with more manifest
reluctance and ill-will.</p>

<p>“It’s the burning injustice of the thing I
mind, Maisie,” was the vehement protest hurled
at the inspector’s back. “There were plenty
of people all around whose trunks were hardly
touched. I watched one man myself, and he
never lifted out a single thing—just turned the
corners a little, and smoothed all down again.
He was examining the Hardings’s luggage, too,
and I know they have five times as much as
we have—really costly, beautiful things—and
they never paid a cent.”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t pay a great deal,” returned
the girl cheerfully. She was down on her knees
now, deftly rearranging the disordered trunks.
“Think of all our man might have found, and
didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Think of the shameful condition he left our
clothes in!” said her angry mother. “It is an
outrage. And those blankets! Everybody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
brings them, and nobody but ourselves has to
pay. The Hardings had them, I know, and so
did Miss Rebecca Chambers, and Mrs. Starr;
and they all came in free.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Mr. Maitland was charged four
dollars duty on a pair he bought for twenty
shillings in London, and he presented them to
the custom-house officers rather than give their
value over again,” said Maisie triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Did he, really?” cried her mother, brightening
up wonderfully under the beneficent influence
of other people’s misfortunes. “What
a shame! Four dollars duty on twenty-shilling
blankets! I never heard of anything so
preposterous.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Dr. Carson gave them a silver
watch he had brought over for his little boy,
rather than pay the duty on that, it was so
high,” continued Maisie, who seemed to know
the fate and fortunes of every passenger on
board.</p>

<p>Her mother’s face relaxed from fretfulness
into smiles. “I wonder he doesn’t sue the government,
or something,” she remarked, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
feminine vagueness. “I am sure I should. It
is a good thing, Maisie, we had no watches to
bring.”</p>

<p>The girl chuckled softly, and shook the little
châtelaine by her side. “Yes, it <i>is</i> a good
thing,” she said, with an air of simple conviction.
“After all, we did get off pretty cheap.
And it was almost worth the money to see the
delicious flourish with which that muddy old
overshoe tumbled on the scene. Don’t <i>you</i>
think,” turning once more appealingly to me,
“that three dollars and ninety cents was little
enough to pay for such a sight?”</p>

<p>Perhaps I did. A laugh is always worth its
price, and in these serious days grows rare at
any figure. Besides, when a great republic condescends
to play an active part in even an indifferent
comedy, it is ill-timed to grumble at
the cost.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MR_WILDES_INTENTIONS">MR. WILDE’S <i>INTENTIONS</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Ever since the first printers with misguided
zeal dipped an innocent world
in ink, those books have been truly popular
which reflected faithfully and enthusiastically
the foibles and delusions of the hour. This
is what is called “keeping abreast with the
spirit of the times,” and we have only to look
around us at present to see the principle at
work. With an arid and dreary realism chilling
us to the heart, and sad-voiced novelists entreating
us at every turn to try to cultivate indecorous
conduct and religious doubts, fiction has ceased
to be a medium of delight. Even nihilism, which
is the only form of relief that true earnestness
permits, is capable of being overstrained, and
some narrowly conservative people are beginning
to ask themselves already whether this
new development of “murder as a fine art”
has not been sufficiently encouraged. Out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the midst of the gloom, out of the confusion
and depression of conflicting forms of seriousness,
rises from London a voice, clear, languid,
musical, shaken with laughter, and speaking
in strange, sweet tones of art and beauty, and
of that finer criticism which is one with art
and beauty, and claims them forever as its
own. The voice comes from Mr. Oscar Wilde,
and few there are who listen to him, partly
because his philosophy is alien to our prevalent
modes of thought, and partly because of
the perverse and paradoxical fashion in which
he delights to give it utterance. People are
more impressed by the way a thing is said
than by the thing itself. A grave arrogance
of demeanor, a solemn and self-assertive method
of reiterating an opinion until it grows
weighty with words, are weapons more convincing
than any subtlety of argument. “As
I have before expressed to the still reverberating
discontent of two continents”—this is the
mode in which the public loves to have a statement
offered to its ears, that it may gape, and
wonder, and acquiesce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>Nothing can be further from such admirable
solidity than Mr. Wilde’s flashing sword-play,
than the glee with which he makes out a case
against himself, and then proceeds valiantly
into battle. There are but four essays in the
volume, rather vaguely called <i>Intentions</i>, and of
these four only two have real and permanent
value. “The Truth of Masks” is a somewhat
trivial paper, inserted apparently to help fill up
the book, and “Pen, Pencil, and Poison” is visibly
lacking in sincerity. The author plays with
his subject very much as his subject, “kind,
light-hearted Wainwright,” played with crime,
and in both cases there is a subtle and discordant
element of vulgarity. It is not given to our
eminently respectable age to reproduce the
sumptuous and horror-laden atmosphere which
lends an artistic glamor to the poisonous court
of the Medicis. This “study in green” contains,
however, some brilliant passages, and at least
one sentence—“The domestic virtues are not
the true basis of art, though they may serve as
an excellent advertisement for second-rate
artists”—that must make Mr. George Moore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
pale with envy, when he reflects that he missed
saying it, where it belongs, in his clever,
truthful, ill-natured paper on “Mummer-Worship.”</p>

<p>The significance and the charm of Mr.
Wilde’s book are centred in its opening chapter,
“The Decay of Lying,” reprinted from
<i>The Nineteenth Century</i>, and in the long two-part
essay, entitled “The Critic as Artist,”
which embodies some of his most thoughtful,
serious, and scholarly work. My own ineffable
content rests with “The Decay of Lying,” because,
under its transparent mask of cynicism,
its wit, its satire, its languid mocking humor,
lies clearly outlined a great truth that is slipping
fast away from us—the absolute independence
of art—art nourished by imagination
and revealing beauty. This is the hand that
gilds the grayness of the world; this is the
voice that sings in flute tones through the silence
of the ages. To degrade this shining
vision into a handmaid of nature, to maintain
that she should give us photographic pictures
of an unlovely life, is a heresy that arouses in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
Mr. Wilde an amused scorn which takes the
place of anger. “Art,” he says, “never expresses
anything but itself. It has an independent
life, just as Thought has, and develops
purely on its own lines. It is not necessarily
realistic in an age of realism, nor spiritual in
an age of faith. So far from being the creation
of its time, it is usually in direct opposition to
it, and the only history that it preserves for us
is the history of its own progress.” That we
should understand this, it is necessary to understand
also the “beautiful untrue things”
which exist only in the world of fancy; the
things that are lies, and yet help us to endure
the truth. Mr. Wilde repudiates distinctly and
almost energetically all lying with an object,
all sordid trifling with a graceful gift. The
lies of newspapers yield him no pleasure; the
lies of politicians are ostentatiously unconvincing;
the lies of lawyers are “briefed by the
prosaic.” He reviews the world of fiction with
a swift and caustic touch; he lingers among
the poets; he muses rapturously over those
choice historic masterpieces, from Herodotus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
to Carlyle, where “facts are either kept in
their proper subordinate position, or else entirely
excluded on the general ground of dulness.”
He laments with charming frankness
the serious virtues of his age. “Many a young
man,” he says, “starts in life with a natural
gift for exaggeration, which, if nurtured in congenial
and sympathetic surroundings, or by
the imitation of the best models, might grow
into something really great and wonderful.
But, as a rule, he comes to nothing. He either
falls into careless habits of accuracy, or takes
to frequenting the society of the aged and the
well-informed. Both things are equally fatal
to his imagination, and in a short time he develops
a morbid and unhealthy faculty of truth-telling,
begins to verify all statements made in
his presence, has no hesitation in contradicting
people who are much younger than himself,
and often ends by writing novels that are so
like life that no one can possibly believe in
their probability.” Surely this paragraph has
but one peer in the world of letters, and that
is the immortal sentence wherein De Quincey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
traces the murderer’s gradual downfall to incivility
and procrastination.</p>

<p>“The Critic as Artist” affords Mr. Wilde
less scope for his humor and more for his erudition,
which, perhaps, is somewhat lavishly
displayed. Here he pleads for the creative
powers of criticism, for its fine restraints, its
imposed self-culture, and he couches his plea
in words as rich as music. Now and then, it
is true, he seems driven by the whips of our
modern Furies to the verge of things which are
not his to handle—problems, social and spiritual,
to which he holds no key. When this
occurs, we can only wait with drooping heads,
and what patience we can muster, until he is
pleased to return to his theme; or until he remembers,
laughing, how fatal is the habit of
imparting opinions, and what a terrible ordeal
it is to sit at table with the man who has spent
his life in educating others rather than himself.
“For the development of the race depends on
the development of the individual, and where
self-culture has ceased to be the ideal, the intellectual
standard is instantly lowered, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
often ultimately lost.” I like to fancy the
ghost of the late Rector of Lincoln, of him who
said that an appreciation of Milton was the reward
of consummate scholarship, listening in
the Elysian Fields, and nodding his assent to
this much-neglected view of a much-disputed
question. Everybody is now so busy teaching
that nobody has any time to learn. We are
growing rich in lectures, but poor in scholars,
and the triumph of mediocrity is at hand. Mr.
Wilde can hardly hope to become popular by
proposing real study to people burning to impart
their ignorance; but the criticism that
develops in the mind a more subtle quality of
apprehension and discernment is the criticism
that creates the intellectual atmosphere of the
age.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HUMORS_OF_GASTRONOMY">HUMORS OF GASTRONOMY</h2>

</div>

<p>“There does not, at this blessed moment,
breathe on the earth’s surface a human
being that willna prefer eating and drinking to
all ither pleasures o’ body or soul.” So speaks
the Ettrick Shepherd, in the fulness of his content,
contemplating with moist eyes the groaning
supper-table, laden with a comfortable
array of solid viands; after which fair and
frank expression of his views we are somewhat
pained to hear him denouncing in no measured
terms “the awful and fearsome vice o’ gluttony,”
as evidenced occasionally in women.
His companions, too, those magnificent fellow-feeders,
have a great many severe things to
say about gudewives who betray a weakness
for roasted pork, or an unfeminine solicitude for
gravy; and Mr. Timothy Tickler unhesitatingly
affirms that such a one, “eating for the sake
of eating, and not for mere nourishment, is, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
fact, the grossest of sensualists, and at each
mouthful virtually breaks all ten of the commandments.”
This is the language of an ascetic
rather than of a <i>bon vivant</i>, but we are in
some measure reassured when the same Mr.
Tickler confesses, a little later, that, although
roast goose always disagrees with him, yet
he never refuses it, believing that to purchase
pleasure by a certain degree of pain is true
philosophy; whereupon the Shepherd, not to
be outdone, gives it as his unreserved opinion
that, in winter-time at least, “eating for eating’s
sake, and in oblivion o’ its feenal cause,
is the most sacred o’ household duties.”</p>

<p>From these somewhat inharmonious sentiments
we reluctantly infer that gluttony is a
vice—or a virtue—for man only, and that woman’s
part in the programme is purely that of
a ministering angel. Adam was made to eat,
and Eve to cook for him, although, even in this
humble sphere, she and her daughters have
been doomed to rank second in command.
Excellent in all things, but supreme in none,
they have never yet scaled the dazzling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
heights of culinary fame. The records of antiquity
make no mention of their skill; the
middle ages grant them neither praise nor
honor; and even as late as Dr. Johnson’s day
they labored hard for scanty recognition. It
is very painful to hear the great sage speaking
lightly of our grandmother’s oracle, Mrs.
Glasse, and declaring with robust contempt
that women were fit to spin, but not to write a
book of cookery. Yet for how many years had
they modestly held their peace; profiting,
doubtless, in many a roomy kitchen and in
many a well-stocked buttery by the words of
wisdom which vainglorious men let fall; and
only now and then giving help and counsel to
one another by means of little private recipe-books,
which were circulated among a few
noble families, and were considered as their
own exclusive property and pride.</p>

<p>Opulence and a taste for display, upon the
one side, and the natural conservatism of the
great Saxon stock, upon the other, fought the
battle of the table from the days of the Black
Prince down to those of Anthony Trollope,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
and will, in all probability, fight it to the end.
“A cod’s head for fourpence, and nine shillings’
worth of condiments to serve with it,”
was the favorite sarcasm which greeted the
growing extravagance of the rich middle
classes. Those costly “subtleties” imported
from French kitchens in the fifteenth century
met with a sturdy opposition from British free-men,
who, even while they gaped and marveled,
resented such bewildering innovations.
The pelican sheltering her young, and Saint
Catherine, book in hand, disputing with the
doctors, which figured among the dishes at
the coronation of Henry V.; the hundred and
four “dressed” peacocks, trailing their plumes
gorgeously over the table at the consecration
of Archbishop Neville, affronted more than
one beef-eating gentleman, and exasperated
more than one porridge-eating churl. From
France, too, came certain heresies regarding
the fitness of food which Englishmen had for
centuries devoured and digested. Queen
Elizabeth dined upon whale; Cardinal Wolsey,
who was something of an epicure, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
who first taught us that strawberries and cream
were intended by a beneficent nature to set off
each other’s merits, did not disdain to have a
young porpoise served up at one of his banquets.
Fish soup was a delicacy, and we are
even assured by antiquarians that the grampus,
or sea-wolf, was freely eaten by our
strong-stomached ancestors.</p>

<p>But foreign cooks looked doubtfully upon
these national dainties, and, in place of the
old-time gravies, which were simply the broths
in which meat had been boiled, flavored with
a little ginger and sugar, delicate and highly
seasoned sauces were devised for the tempting
of weary appetites. Italy sent forks—those
curious and uncanny implements—which were
received with scornful indignation, as calculated
to destroy the simplicity and manliness
of Great Britain. Spoons and knives were
held in slight esteem, for good soup could be
swallowed from the bowl, and his sacred Majesty,
Charles XII. of Sweden, was not the only
monarch who buttered his bread with his royal
thumb. But forks were contemptible affectations.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
As honest Master Breton observed, he
had done no foul work, and handled no unwholesome
thing, and consequently had no
need of an instrument with which to make hay
of his food and pitch it into his mouth. So,
too, the time-honored custom of man and wife
eating out of one trencher was falling into
rapid disuse, and Walpole tells us that the old
Duke and Duchess of Hamilton were the last
couple in England who retained the fashion of
their youth. Meats were growing daintier and
dearer all the while. The ordinary or inn
dinner, which in Elizabeth’s day cost sixpence,
had risen to tenpence in the reign of George I.,
and soon crept up to a shilling. In every
generation there were plenty of grumblers to
lament over the good old times that had fled,
and we catch the echo of this undying cry in
the modern protests against unwelcome fashions.
Thackeray and Trollope railed perpetually
at that feeble striving after an impossible
elegance which had well-nigh destroyed the
cheery conviviality of their youth; and Peacock,
the prince of good livers, with whom the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
pleasures of the intellect and the appetite
walked amicably hand in hand, has recorded
his still more vehement denunciation: “I detest
and abominate,” says Mr. Macborrowdale,
“the idea of a Siberian dinner, where you just
look on fiddle-faddles, while your meal is behind
a screen, and you are served with rations
like a pauper.”</p>

<p>The scorn of the true Briton for alien delicacies
was repaid with interest by the Frenchman,
who regarded his neighbor’s groaning
table very much as we might regard the doubtful
provender of a cannibal chief. The contempt
for frog-eating foreigners, on the one
hand, was not greater than the contempt for
beef-eating islanders, on the other; in fact, all
nations, from Egypt down, seem to have cherished
a wholesome dislike and distrust for each
other’s food. The British officer who, at the
attack on Cadiz, shouted to his men, “You
Englishmen, who are fed upon beef, don’t surely
mean to be beaten by a d—d lot of Spaniards,
who live on oranges!” made a stronger appeal
to human nature than did Napoleon with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
famous “forty centuries;” and the reverse of
the medal may be seen in Talleyrand’s description
of England, as a land where there
were twenty-four religions and only one sauce.
Twenty-four religions would make but a poor
showing in these days, when even a serious
novel can beget a new one; but sauces are not
so lightly called into being. Those “slibber
sops” which brought “queesiness to the stomach
and disquiet to the mind” of John Lyly
were hard to rout from the field; and they
were still holding their own when Brillat-Savarin,
the most serene and kindly of epicures,
first visited Great Britain. With Savarin, eating
was more than a mere vulgar pleasure;
it was a solemn and yet exquisite duty which
man owed to himself, and to a generous nature
that had yielded him up her bounties for this
purpose. Mr. Birrell says that Burke’s letters
on carrots “tremble with emotion,” and there
is a like earnestness about all of Savarin’s recipes;
a pathetic anxiety lest some ingredient
should be omitted or ill-used. For fish he
entertains a profound respect; for game, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
manly affection; for pastries, a delicate regard;
but truffles are the beloved darlings of his
heart. It contents him greatly to sit at table
with congenial spirits; to watch “the eagerness
of desire, the ecstasy of enjoyment, and,
finally, the perfect repose of bliss on every
countenance,” when the noble meal is ended.
Surely even the Reign of Terror might have
dealt tenderly with such a man as this, since
patriots are unswerving eaters, and it behooved
them to remember that “the discovery of a
new dish does more for the happiness of mankind
than the discovery of a new planet.”</p>

<p>All of Savarin’s apothegms evince the same
frank and warm-hearted regard for the welfare
of others; the same unremitting anxiety
to teach them what to eat and how to eat it.
He entreats us never to forget that, when we
have invited a man to dine, we have, for a
short time at least, his happiness in our hands.
The dinner table, he reminds us, is the only
place where men are not hopelessly bored for
the first hour, and during that hour it is our
privilege to make them enamored of life. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
cook is, in his eyes, a true scientist, with
mighty capacities for good and evil. He believes,
with Baudelaire, that such a one should
have the soul of a poet, and—like the too fastidious
Parisian, who declared that between
Mme. du Deffand’s <i>chef</i> and the Marquise de
Brinvilliers “there was only the difference of
intention”—Savarin has no words of reproach
strong enough for those who debase and shame
their noble calling. He is prompt to recognize
the exigencies of a slender purse, and unwearying
in his efforts to provide <i>menus</i> fitted to its
limitations; but his notions of economy are
somewhat like those of the little French princess,
who said that rather than starve she
would live on bread and cheese. The famous
<i>omelette au thon</i>, for instance, with all its air
of pastoral simplicity, contains the roes of two
carp, a piece of tunny, an eschalot, twelve eggs,
and a number of other ingredients which
would hardly recommend it to a poor country
parsonage. As for the Abbé Chevrier’s spinach,
which was warmed up with butter for
seven days before it reached the acme of delicacy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
we can only wonder at the admirable
patience of the Abbé’s cook, who would return
seven times with unremitting industry to the
consideration of a single dish.</p>

<p>It will be observed, however, how many gastronomical
triumphs we owe to clerical genius,
or to the researches of the true philosopher.
Lord Bacon thought it no shame to bend his
mighty mind to kitchen problems, and Dr.
Nowel, the learned and pious dean of St. Paul’s,
was rightfully proud of the bottled beer which
he first gave to his astonished and grateful
country. The earliest list of recipes in England
was the work of an archbishop. The
Jesuits in the seventeenth century carried the
turkey from its native haunts, and introduced
it to the best French society, who received it
with the rapture it deserved. The famous
<i>mayonnaise</i> is not the only delicacy which
Richelieu bequeathed to the world; Talleyrand
devoted one hour out of every busy day
to the exclusive companionship of his cook;
and the Regent Orleans was pleased to give
his own name to the bread of his own baking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>What a kindly spirit of good-fellowship we
discern in the frank epicureanism of Sydney
Smith! what generous sympathy for a <i>bon
vivant</i> whose lines have led him into desert
places! “Luttrell came over for a day,” he
writes, “from whence I know not, but I
thought not from good quarters; at least he
had not his usual soup and patti look. There
was a forced smile upon his countenance which
seemed to indicate plain roast and boiled, a
sort of apple-pudding depression, as if he had
been staying with a clergyman.” How creditable,
too, is his anxiety to please Luttrell,
when that amiable sybarite becomes <i>his</i> guest!
“Mrs. Sydney,” he declares, “grows pale with
alarm as the rich dishes are uncovered;” and
yet so admirable a housewife might have shared
in the superb confidence of Lord Worcester
when cautioned by Sir Henry Halford to leave
all such indiscreet messes alone. “Side
dishes,” said the great physician, “are poison.”
“Yours may be,” retorted Lord Worcester;
“and I should never dream of eating them,
but mine are a very different story.” So, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
were Sydney Smith’s, and the celebrated salad
which gained for him nearly as wide a reputation
as his wit was only one of many famous
recipes, and probably no greater in its way
than the mysterious pudding whose secret he
imparted as an especial favor to the importunate
Lady Holland. Those who had the happiness
of sitting at his table rose from it with
tranquil gratitude, “serenely full,” and conscious,
let us hope, of his own graceful sentiment,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fate cannot harm me—I have dined to-day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is one more subject to consider; one
more aspect of the case, fraught with tender
and melancholy associations. Like the lost
joys of our youth; like the taste for apple-dumplings,
which Lamb recognized as belonging
only to those whose innocence was unimpaired;
like the vanishing of gentle thoughts
with a growing distaste for asparagus; so is
the sorrowful blank left in our lives by the
recollection of noble dishes that have been,
and that are no longer. What of that lost recipe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
of Menander’s for fish sauce—an ambrosial
sauce whose fame has flitted down to us from
dim ages, and the eating of which would have
filled to the brim Dr. Johnson’s cup of happiness?
And what of its modern counterpart,
now also gone forever, the famous green sauce
which La Coste offered to Sir Thomas Dundas
at the Duke of York’s table, whispering to
him with unctuous fervor, “<i>Avec cette sauce là,
on pourrait manger son grand-père</i>”? What
of the bream-pie that disappeared with the
good monks, driven from British soil, and the
mere recollection of which caused Peacock to
bewail in spirit the too rapid dissolution of the
monasteries? And what of sack—<i>Falstaff’s</i>
sack—that made England the merry England
of yore, and that took flight, like some
old-fashioned genius, before the sombre days
that were to follow? Surely if we knew its
secret, we should learn how to laugh once
more.</p>

<p>But alas! this may not be. We have but
the memories of past good cheer; we have but
the echoes of departed laughter. In vain we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
look and listen for the mirth that has died
away. In vain we seek to question the gray
ghosts of old-time revelers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHILDREN_IN_FICTION">CHILDREN IN FICTION</h2>

</div>

<p>Mr. Rudyard Kipling has prefaced
his little volume of <i>Child Stories</i> with
a modest intimation that he finds the subject
almost beyond his grasp. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Only women understand children thoroughly; but
if a mere man keeps very quiet, and humbles himself
properly, and refrains from talking down to his superiors,
the children will sometimes be good to him, and
let him see what they think about in the world. Yet,
even after patient investigation and the condescension
of the nursery, it is hard to draw babies.”</p>

</div>

<p>This sounds disarming, and at the same time
strikes a popular note respecting these fortunate
little people, who, after having been considered
for many years as unworthy of the
novelist’s regard, have now suddenly grown
too complex and subtle for him to hope to understand.
Mr. Kipling himself approaches
them with great caution, and treats them with
careful conventionality, except in that pitiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
bit of realism, “Baa, Baa, Black Sheep,” where
the misery and swift deterioration of a child
are almost too painfully portrayed. Punch,
with his dim comprehension of his own unhappiness,
and his pathetic attempts to be
friendly and “oblige everybody;” Punch,
swaying alternately from clumsy deception to
helpless rage, badgered into sullenness, and
betrayed by the inherent weakness of his poor,
peace-loving little soul, is a picture burdened
with bitter truth, drawn with revengeful fidelity.
Once, I am sure, a half-blind, solitary
boy measured those lonely rooms in hand
spans: “fifty down the side, thirty across, and
fifty back again—one hundred and eighty-one
exactly from the hall door to the top of the
first landing.” Once, I am sure, he knocked
his blundering head against the walls, and upset
the glasses that he tried to grasp, in the
gathering gloom of his doubly darkened life.</p>

<p>But when we turn from the sad sincerity of
“Black Sheep” to the brighter atmosphere of
the other tales, we find nothing very genuine or
convincing about the happier children who figure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
in them. “Drums of the Fore and Aft” is an
exceedingly clever story, and Lew and Jakin
may be typical British drummer boys, but to
the uninitiated reader they seem a trifle over-drawn
both for good and evil. They know so
much and talk so marvelously; they are so very
bad and so very upright; and they insert such a
bewildering number of “bloomin’s” into their
conversation, that, like the eternal “well” with
which Mr. Howells’s women begin all their sentences,
the word loses its <i>vraisemblance</i> through
unbearable repetition. “His Majesty the King,”
even when we forgive him his cumbersome
title which destroys all good-fellowship at
once, is a child dear to story-writers, and consecrated
to their uses for many years, but so
exceedingly rare in every-day-life that he has
to be taken strictly on faith; while “Wee Willie
Winkie” is even more unveracious in his
character. These wonderful babes, with their
sense of honor, and chivalry, and manhood,
these Bayards in pinafores, these miniature
editions of King Arthur and Sir Launcelot
rolled into one, are picturesque possibilities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
only when we have forgotten what an earthly
little animal a real boy is. Willie Winkie rides
into a forbidden and dangerous country to
protect and rescue a woman nearly old enough
to be his mother. He is keenly and conscientiously
distressed because, having been told to
keep within doors, he has thus “bwoken” his
“awwest;” but he feels it his paramount duty
to pursue and guard from evil the able-bodied
betrothed of his father’s friend. When Miss
Allardyce accommodates herself to circumstances
by promptly wrenching her ankle, and
the pair are surrounded by ruffians of the skulking,
cowardly Indian type whom Mr. Kipling
paints with such generous scorn, we are gravely
told: “Then rose from the rock Wee Willie
Winkie, child of the Dominant Race, aged
six and three-quarters, and said briefly and
emphatically, ‘<i>Jao!</i>’” What “<i>Jao</i>” means is
lost to our occidental ignorance, but the effect
is magical. The twenty armed men thus confronted
and defied are awed into milder measures,
and finally routed with shame, while the
hero of the hour restores the prostrate heroine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
unharmed—save for the wrenched ankle—to
her lover’s anxious embraces.</p>

<p>This is very amusing, but a little absurd,
and a little vulgar as well. It strikes that jarring
note of provincialism which Matthew Arnold
condemns with all the weight of his critical
eloquence in Kinglake’s “Invasion of the
Crimea.” “Wee Willie Winkie, child of the
Dominant Race,” is on a literary level with
the description of Marshal St. Arnaud, cowed
by “the majesty of the great Elchi’s Canning
brow and tight, merciless lips;” a style of
writing bad enough in newspaper correspondence,
but unpardonable in artistic fiction. How
has it happened that Mr. Kipling, who tells us
with such irresistible grace and simplicity the
“Story of Muhammad Din,” should stray into
mock heroics when handling the children of
his own nation, the jolly well-bred little English
lads, to whom all picturesque posing is an
art unknown.</p>

<p>Perhaps the trouble lies in the curious but
highly esteemed fallacy that the child of fiction
is expected to be always precocious and sprightly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
to emit sparks like a cat, and electrify the
sluggish atmosphere about him. He does this
at the expense alike of his sincerity and of his
manners; we cannot accept him as a fact, and we
don’t approve of him as a theory. A few years
ago a critic in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> protested
very seriously against such writers as
Florence Montgomery, “by whom the bloom
of unconsciousness has been wiped from childhood,
and boys and girls have learned to see
themselves, not like old-fashioned children, as
good and naughty, but as picturesque beings,
whose naughtiness has an attractive charm,
and whose very imperfections of dialect are
worth accurate record.” Most of us are only
too familiar with this kind of fiction, which for
a time enjoyed such great and hurtful popularity.
The patronizing attitude of children to their
parents is sufficiently illustrated by the really
nice little boy in “Transformed,” who calls his
father “Puppy,” a most objectionable thing
for a nice little boy to do; while what might
be termed the corrective attitude of children
to their parents is still more sharply defined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
by that unpleasant child, Nina Middleton, who
sees so clearly, and suffers so intensely from
the “careless superficiality” and rigid narrowness
of the unfortunate couple whose painful
privilege it was to have given her birth.</p>

<p>One of the latest types, however, to seize and
hold the hearts of the big, sentimental, child-loving
public is Mrs. Burnett’s Lord Fauntleroy,
who maybe best described as the good little boy
with the clothes. It is quite impossible to separate
him in our minds from his wardrobe, to
divest him of his velvet suits and sashes, his
“rich Vandyke lace collar,” his leggings and
neat little Oxford ties. He is always and in all
places “a small copy of the fairy prince,” picturesquely
grouped with a dog, or a cat, or a
pony, as circumstances direct. We cannot be
coarse enough to imagine him with cropped
hair, and muddy boots, and a torn jacket, and
a hole in his stocking, like so many, many real
little boys who daily break their mothers’
hearts by their profound neglect of appearances.
He is so ready in conversation, too,
and pays such charming compliments to pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
young ladies, instead of hustling into corners
and staring owlishly, after the fashion of those
awkward little boys I know. And he is so
very, very good! Not consciously and morbidly
virtuous like that baby prig, Little Saint
Elizabeth, who comes from the same hands,
but artlessly and inevitably correct. He gives
all his money to pay poor Michael’s rent, and
we rejoice rightly in his generosity, with only
one wistful recollection of that vastly different
specimen of boyhood, for whose misdeeds Mr.
Aldrich is responsible, and who spends his
funds gloriously in indigestible treats to his
friends. It is very charming in Lord Fauntleroy
to offer his eager plea in behalf of the
farmer Higgins, and probably just what any
warm-hearted child would have done in his
place; but we cannot but contrast his wonderful
unconsciousness afterward, “not realizing
his own importance in the least,” with the familiar
figure of little Paul Dombey strutting up
and down the room at Brighton, full of the
new-blown dignity of being a financier, and
lending young Gay the money for his uncle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
It would take the sternest of moralists to object
to Paul’s infantile strut; it would take the
most trusting of sentimentalists to believe that
Cedric is quite as innocently unconscious as he
seems.</p>

<p>There is a remarkably nice little girl in that
pleasant English novel, published a few years
ago, <i>Sir Charles Danvers</i>—a little girl who
can be safely recommended to all child-lovers,
who will only wish they could hear a great
deal more about her. Molly Danvers is not
particularly precocious; she is not at all supersensitive,
and we are not even told that she is
pretty. There is absolutely no inventory given
of her personal charms; and as to her clothes,
“a white frock and two slim black legs” are
casually mentioned on her first introduction,
and we never hear another word about them.
“A white frock and two slim black legs!”
Could any description be more meagre? Imagine
Little Saint Elizabeth, or Sara Crewe, reduced
ruthlessly to a white frock, and not another
allusion to their wardrobes in the whole
course of their histories. But Molly doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
care. I have a suspicion that her white frocks
don’t stay white very long, and that her slim
black legs are better distinguished for activity
than for grace. She is anything but heroic,
and runs fleetly away from danger, leaving both
her cousin and her donkey to their fate; but she
has a loving little heart, nevertheless, and when
her terrier dies, this heart is as nearly broken
as a healthy little girl’s can be.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘He is <i>dead</i>, Uncle Charles. He was quite well,
and eating Albert biscuits with the dolls this morning,
and now’—the rest was too dreadful, and Molly burst
into a flood of tears, and burrowed with her head
against the faithful waistcoat of Uncle Charles—of
Uncle Charles, the friend, the consoler of all the ills
that Molly had so far been heir to.</p>

<p>“‘Vic had a very happy life, Molly,’ said Charles,
pressing the little brown head against his cheek, and
vaguely wondering what it would be like to have any
one to turn to in time of trouble.</p>

<p>“‘I always kept trouble from him except that time
I shut him in the door,’ gasped Molly. ‘I never took
him out in a string, and he only wore his collar—that
collar you gave him that made him scratch so—on Sundays.’</p>

<p>“‘And he was not ill a long time? He did not suffer
any pain?’</p>

<p>“‘No, Uncle Charles, not much. But, though he did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
not say anything, his face looked worse than screaming,
and he passed away very stiff in his hind-legs.
Oh!’ (with a fresh outburst) ‘when cook told me that
her sister that was in a decline had gone, I never
thought’ (sob, sob!) ‘poor Vic would be the next.’”</p>

</div>

<p>This is not the less heartrending for being
amusing, and that short sentence “his face
looked worse than screaming” is a master-stroke
of realistic description. On the whole,
for ordinary family purposes, Molly Danvers is
one of the nicest little girls I know; and if we
seek—as many people rightly seek—for the
poetry, the beauty of childhood, subtly transferred
to paper, let us turn back a few years,
and re-read for the fifth or the fiftieth time, as
it chances, those seven delicious chapters of
<i>Quatre-Vingt-Treize</i>, which describe a single
day in the lives of the three babies, René Jean,
Gros Alain, and Georgette. How many hours
must Victor Hugo have watched patiently and
gladly the ways of little children before he
could paint them with such minute and charming
truth, and what sheer delight is embodied
in every line! They do nothing remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
these tiny French peasants; they say nothing
worth noting; they are clothed in rags; they
are alone all day; they are mischievous, healthy,
and natural. They hang enchanted, all three,
over a wood-louse, their curls touching, their
breath suspended, their eyes fixed on the embarrassed
insect: and we watch them with a
joy and wonder equal to their own. “It is a
she-creature,” announces René Jean, and
Georgette laughs, Georgette who, at twenty
months, has not yet acquired the art of conversation.
She utters a single word from time
to time, but sentences lie beyond her scope.
She is occupied with grave thoughts, and when
she breathes a soft monosyllable, her brothers
pause encouragingly to listen. A belated bee
comes buzzing in the window and departs.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘She is going home,’ said René Jean.</p>

<p>“‘It is a beast,’ said Gros Alain. ‘No,’ said René
Jean, ‘it is a fly.’ ‘A f’y,’ said Georgette.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is the extent of their conversational
powers, and how very limited it seems. They
do not talk, these babies; they act. They lay
their destructive hands on the rare old folio of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
<i>Saint Bartholomew</i>, and tear out the leaves
one by one, solemnly, innocently, conscientiously.
Georgette, who cannot reach the volume,
sits on the floor, and tears each leaf into
little pieces with painstaking amiability; and
all three are so happy over their self-appointed
task. By the side of their absolute unconsciousness,
the Willie Winkies and Lord Fauntleroys
of romance grow suddenly Utopian and
unreal. The chivalry, honor, generosity, loyalty,
picturesqueness, and brilliancy, all the
story-book virtues of story-book children, seem
less winning and less dear than the birdlike
contentment of three silent, sleepy little creatures,
curled softly together, and painted by a
master’s hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THREE_FAMOUS_OLD_MAIDS">THREE FAMOUS OLD MAIDS</h2>

</div>

<p>It is a curious fact that three of the most
successful and eminent literary women in
England—Miss Austen, Miss Edgeworth, and
Miss Mitford—should have been typical old
maids; not merely unmarried through stress of
intervening circumstances—ill health, early
disappointment, or a self-sacrificing devotion
to other cares—but women whose lives were
rounded and completed without that element
which we are taught to believe is the main-spring
and prime motor of existence. To understand
how thoroughly this was the case, we
have but to turn to a later and very different
writer, Charlotte Brontë, who married when
she was thirty-eight, and died one year afterward,
and whose whole literary life was accordingly
passed in spinsterhood. Yet if that
very grave and respectable gentleman, the
Rev. Mr. Nicholls, had never appeared upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
the scene at all, it would have been impossible
to call Miss Brontë a typical old maid. She
had the outward signs of one, indeed, the prim
demeanor, the methodical habits, the sarcastic
attitude toward the male sex; but burning in
every fibre of her being, and evident in every
page of her writings, is that fierce unrest, that
inarticulate, distressful longing of a woman
who craves love. We can easily imagine
Elizabeth Bennet, and the very sensible Elinor
Dashwood, and even Emma Woodhouse,
dearest and brightest of girls, slipping from
their lovers’ grasp and growing into old maids
as charming as was Miss Austen herself; but
poor plain Jane Eyre, and that reticent little
school-teacher, Lucy Snowe, are shaken and
consumed with the passion of their own desires.
Such women cannot walk from the cradle to
the grave, handling their lives with delicate
satisfaction and content; they must find what
they need or die.</p>

<p>It is amusing to note how the various critics
and biographers of Miss Austen, Miss Edgeworth,
and Miss Mitford have debated and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
fretted over the painful lack of romance in
their careers. Feminine critics, especially, find
it difficult to believe that there is no hidden
tale to tell, no secret and justifiable cause for
this otherwise inexplicable behavior; and much
time and patience have been exhausted in
dragging shadowy memories to light. In the
case of Miss Mitford, indeed, it seems quite
hopeless to search for even the ghost of a love-story,
and, although she certainly did devote
her life with touching unselfishness to the comfort
and support of a very exacting father, it
cannot for a moment be urged that, in so doing,
she relinquished any distinct desire or
prospect of matrimony. Perhaps the exasperating
qualities of her parent inclined her unconsciously
to remain single; for, with all her
unsparing devotion, she must, in the course of
sorely tried years, have grown to regard men
very much as Dolly Winthrop regarded them,—“in
the light of animals whom it had pleased
Heaven to make naturally troublesome.” Mr.
Mitford, a most genial and handsome old gentleman
of the Turveydrop pattern, managed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
to keep his daughter’s hands full of work, and
her heart full of love, and left her little chance
or disposition for any wandering fancies. All
the exuberant affection of her girlhood, all the
mature attachment of later years, were concentrated
upon him alone. Her youth waned, her
freshness faded, her indomitable courage and
cheerfulness quailed a little before the ever-increasing
burdens of her life; but through it
all, in joy and sorrow, no shadow of a suitor
stands beckoning by her side. Her serene old
age was haunted by no dim voices crying
out of the past for the joy which had slipped
from her grasp. She wrote love-stories by the
score, always approaching the subject from the
outside, and treating it with the easy conventionality,
the generous yet imperfect sympathy
of a warm-hearted woman not prone to analyze
motives. They are very pleasant stories
for the most part, sensible, healthy, and happy;
but they are not convincing. The reader feels
that if Polly did not marry Joe she would be
just as well satisfied with William, and that if
Edwin failed to win Angelina he would soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
content himself with Dorothy. This is a comfortable
state of affairs, and doubtless true to
life; but it is not precisely the element which
makes a successful love-tale. The fact is, Miss
Mitford described things pretty much as she
found them, not seeking to dive below the surface,
and always adding a little sunshine of her
own. She was a happy woman, save for some
sad years of overwork, and her life was full of
pleasant detail, of cherished duties, and of
felicitous labor; but, from first to last, love had
no part in it, and, fancy free, she never reckoned
of her loss.</p>

<p>Miss Edgeworth, too, seems to have been
lifted from the sphere of matrimony by the unusual
strength of her family affections. Her
devotion to her father, to her two stepmothers,
and to her nineteen brothers and sisters was of
such an absorbing nature as to leave her little
leisure or inclination for mere matters of sentiment.
She was so busy too, so full of pleasant
cares, and successful work, and a thousand-and-one
delightful interests; above all, she
clung so fondly to her home, and country, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
the familiar faces she had known from baby-hood,
that love had no chance to storm her
well-defended walls. When that handsome
and earnest young Swede, he of the “superior
understanding and mild manners,” came to
woo, he found, alas! that the lady could not
tear her heart away from Ireland and her
beautiful young stepsisters to give it to his
keeping. She acknowledged his merits, both
his mildness and his superiority, she liked and
admired him in every way; but marry and go
to Sweden!—that she would not do, either
for M. Edelcrantz or any other man. Mrs.
Edgeworth, who was distinctly sentimental,
and who would have been delighted to see her
clever stepdaughter happily wedded, says
quite touchingly that Maria was mistaken in
the strength of her own feelings; that she
really loved M. Edelcrantz, but refused to
marry him because her family could not bear
to part with her, because “she would not have
suited his position at the court of Stockholm,”
and because she feared her lack of beauty
would one day lessen his regard. Shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
shadows! Was there ever a woman who declined
to marry the man she truly loved for
such cloud-built reasoning as this! Maria was
doubtless the darling of her own home circle,
and would have been sorely missed had she
winged her flight to Sweden; but there were
daughters enough in that overflowing household
to admit of one being spared. As for the
other obstacles, it is hardly possible that they
should have been urged seriously by a woman
as free from morbid sentiment as was Miss
Edgeworth. There is a sweet humility which
is born of love, and which whispers to most
women—and, probably, to some men—that
they are unworthy of the choice which has
fallen upon them, of the jewel which has been
flung at their feet. But to push this delicate
emotion so far as to sacrifice happiness at its
bidding is not the impulse of a sound and
healthy nature. Miss Edgeworth could never
have been pretty, and had spent most of her
life in retirement; but she was by no means
unacquainted with the ways of the world, by
no means destitute of womanly charms, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
above all, by no means without the exhilarating
consciousness of success. In fact, when we
read her biography, we are principally impressed
by the amount of adulation she received,
by the extraordinary enthusiasm her
pleasant tales aroused. The struggling novelist
is tempted to wish that he also might have
lived in those halcyon days, until he remembers
that a far greater writer, Miss Austen, had no
share in this universal and unbounded applause.
Miss Edgeworth was as much the pet
of the literary world as of her own household
and friends. She had little need to doubt her
powers, or to fear neglect and indifference. If
she really regretted poor M. Edelcrantz—who
went back to Sweden with a sore heart and
never married anybody else—she gave no outward
token of repentance, but lived to be
eighty-two, the most cheerful and radiant of
old maids, faithful to the last to her family
affections, and happy to die in the midst of
those who had made the sunshine of her life.</p>

<p>It is in the case of Miss Austen, however,
that truly strenuous efforts have been made to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
cultivate a passable romance upon scanty soil.
Miss Austen was pretty, she was gay, she
possessed an indefinable attraction for men,
and she was in turn attracted by them, as a
healthy-minded, happy-hearted girl should be.
Her letters to Cassandra are full of amusing
confidences on the subject—confidences far too
amusing, in fact, to give any sign or token of
genuine feeling beyond. She writes with
buoyant cheerfulness about Mr. Tom Lefroy,
for whom she “does not care sixpence,” yet
prefers him to all other competitors, who must
have ranked pitiably low in the scale. “I am
almost afraid,” she confesses, “to tell you how
my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to
yourself everything most profligate and shocking
in the way of dancing and sitting down together.
I <i>can</i> expose myself, however, <i>only
once more</i>, because he leaves the country soon
after next Friday, on which day we <i>are</i> to
have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very
gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young
man, I assure you.”</p>

<p>Not without grave faults, though, it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
seem, for a little later we hear of a morning
coat which is much too light to please Jane’s
critical eye. She cannot possibly give her
maiden affections to a man who would wear
such a coat, and so, after a while, he disappears
from her pages and her life, to go out
into the world, and win much legal renown,
and be Chief Justice of Ireland, and always to
remember with great tenderness the gay
young girl at Ashe. Then there appears on
the scene that unnamed friend of Mrs. Lefroy’s,
whose love is so sudden and fervent that Miss
Austen feels quite sure it will soon decline into
“sensible indifference,” as, no doubt, it does.
Then the suitor who has “the recommendation
of good character, and a good position in
life, of everything in fact except the subtle
power of touching my heart”—which seems to
have been the real difficulty with them all.
Sir Francis Doyle, indeed, tells a very pretty
and pathetic tale of Jane Austen’s engagement
to a naval officer who, after the peace of 1820,
accompanied his <i>fiancée</i> and her family to
Switzerland. Here he started off on foot one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
fine morning, promising to meet his friends at
Chamouni. He never came, and they waited
and waited with fast-growing fears, only to
learn, when all was over, that the young man
had been seized with a sudden fever, and had
died, unknown and scantily cared for, in some
poor cottage home. It is a sad story, but happily
does not rest upon any shadow of foundation.
Miss Austen never was engaged, and
never was in Switzerland; and although Sir
Francis had the tale from a friend, who had it
from a member of the family, it merely goes
to prove that even relatives are not wholly incapable
of weaving romances out of thin air,
rather than be, like the knife-grinder, without
a tale to tell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Malden, Jane Austen’s enthusiastic biographer,
discredits most unhesitatingly this particular
love-legend, while at the same time she
manifests a lively desire to give form and color
to another, scarcely less intangible. The third
chapter in her little volume is enticingly headed
“Her Life’s One Romance,” and in it is narrated
at some length the story of an attractive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
young clergyman whom Jane and Cassandra
Austen met one summer at a seaside resort in
Devonshire. He openly admired the younger
girl, and, when they parted, “impressed
strongly on the sisters his intention of meeting
them again.” He died, however, shortly after,
and Jane neither gave any outward token of
grief, nor indulged in any confidences on the
subject. Nevertheless, Cassandra, whose own
youth was shadowed by the blight of a lost
love, was wont to say, after her sister’s death,
that she believed this to have been her one
and only romance; and Miss Thackeray, in
her sympathetic sketch of Miss Austen, alludes
very sweetly and very confidently to the tale.</p>

<p>“Here, too,” she says, “is another sorrowful
story. The sisters’ fate (there is a sad
coincidence and similarity in it) was to be
undivided; their life, their experience, was the
same. Some one without a name takes leave
of Jane one day, promising to come back. He
never comes back: long afterwards they hear
of his death. The story seems even sadder
than Cassandra’s in its silence and uncertainty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
for silence and uncertainty are death in life to
some people.”</p>

<p>But if there is one thing more than another
to be avoided and ruthlessly condemned, it is
this quiet assumption that a woman has parted
with her heart, when she herself has breathed
no word to warrant it. The cheerful serenity
of Jane Austen’s daily life showed no ripple of
storm, her lips told no tale; and why are we
to assume that a young man whom she met for
a few idle weeks and never saw again had
broken down the barriers of that self-possessed
nature, had overcome the gay indifference
which showed no signs of hurt? As for the
popular theory that Anne Elliot’s gentle enduring
love and poor Fanny Price’s hours of
bravely borne pain were imaged from the
depth of their author’s experience, we have but
to remember that the same hand gave us Harriet
Smith, with her fluctuating, lightly won
affections, and Charlotte Collins, sensible and
happy, enjoying her pleasant home, and enduring—or
avoiding—her solemn, pompous,
servile, stupid husband. As well connect one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
type as another with the genius that revealed
them all.</p>

<p>“Of Jane herself I know no definite love-tale
to relate,” says her nephew and biographer,
Mr. Austen Leigh; and this seems about the
conclusion of the matter. “No <i>man’s</i> life
could be more entirely free from sentiment,”
admits, very reluctantly, one of her cleverest
critics. “If love be a woman’s chief business,
here is a very sweet woman who had no share
in it. It is a want, but we have no right to
complain, seeing that she did not shape her
course to please us.”</p>

<p>This is a generous reflection on the critic’s
part; but is the want so painfully apparent as
he thinks, or may we not be well content with
Jane Austen as we have her, the central figure
of a little loving family group, the dearest of
daughters and sisters, the gayest and brightest
of aunts, the most charming and incomparable
of old maids?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CHARM_OF_THE_FAMILIAR">THE CHARM OF THE FAMILIAR</h2>

</div>

<p>Those persons are happiest in this restless
and mutable world who are in love
with change, who delight in what is new simply
because it differs from what is old; who rejoice
in every innovation, and find a strange
alert pleasure in all that is, and that has never
been before. With little things as with big
ones, this sentiment is the sentiment of our
day. “Unrest,” says Schopenhauer, “is the
mark of existence,” and the many trifling details
of ordinary life evince on every side the
same keen relish for novelty, the same careless
disregard of the familiar. Especially is this
the case with women, who feel less wistfully
than men the subtle charm of association, and
who have less sympathy than men for the dear,
faulty, unlovely, well-loved things of their
youth. No woman could have written those
pathetic lines of Mr. Lang’s on St. Andrews:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A little city, worn and gray,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">the memory of whose rainwashed, desolate
streets blots out from his mind all the beauty
and the splendor of Oxford. And—to descend
from serious to frivolous subjects—no woman
can wholly appreciate that pleasant sketch of
Mr. Barrie’s, called “My Tobacco Pouch,”
which reveals a mental condition absolutely
inexplicable to the most astute feminine apprehension.
It is the instinctive desire of our sex
for modernism that keeps rolling the great ball
of trade. Manufacturers and shopkeepers would
starve in common if they catered only to men,
who not infrequently have a marked preference
for the archaic. But women, to use the
words of Sir Thomas Browne, are “complexionally
propense to innovation.” With wonderful
pliancy and adaptability they fit easily
into new surroundings, make homes out of
new houses, fill their rooms with new objects,
and grasp a fair share of happiness in the enjoyment
of novelty in every form, whether of
fashion, art, literature, religion or philanthropy.</p>

<p>But what of the unfortunate few who,
through some strange moral twist, are “complexionally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
propense” to sameness; who feel a
passionate regret for what has been lost, and a
passionate reluctance to part with what is fast
slipping away; and who, as the great world
rolls relentlessly on its appointed course, find
themselves “forever broken on the wheel of
time”? The journal of that stout old Tory,
Sir Francis Doyle, betrays a strong dislike,
not only for political upheavals, which are
very uncomfortable and disturbing things, but
for innovations of any kind. “Nothing can be
so good as what is old,” says Mr. Lang; and
Mr. Peacock tranquilly declares that all the
really valuable opinions have been uttered a
thousand years ago. Amid the noisy blare
with which the trumpets of progress herald
every move, comes thrilling now and then a
note of protest from some malcontent who
does not part so easily with the past, and for
whom familiarity lends to every detail of life a
merit and beauty of its own. It almost seems
as if two-thirds of mankind were hard at
work improving away the happiness of the
remaining third, and bidding them at intervals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
to stop grumbling and appreciate the
change.</p>

<p>When it chances that these familiar details
are associated in the mind with pleasures,
early pleasures especially, the memory of
which lingers with the sweetness of honey,
then the pain of parting with them is utterly
disproportioned to their worth. I have never
been able to understand how people can rebind
an old book, or reframe an old picture, if
the book or the picture have been in any way
dear to them for years. How strange and unfriendly
these objects look in their new dress!
How remote they seem from the recollections
hitherto aroused by their presence! One of
the minor grievances of my life is the gradual
disappearance from the theatres of all the old
drop-curtains I can remember since my childish
days. Perhaps the new curtains are better
than the old ones—I hear persons say as much
occasionally—but to me they are simply hideous,
because their native ugliness is unsoftened
by any gracious memory of those far-off
nights when, feverish with delight, I sat staring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
at the stretch of painted canvas, and anticipating
all the joys that lay behind. There
was no moment of transport equal to that
which saw the slow ascent of the mystic veil,
revealing inch by inch the enchanted scenes
beyond; and I still believe that if I could behold
once more those dear, familiar landscapes,
some portion of the old, lost pleasure
would return. Three curtains are indelibly
associated with these hours of supreme happiness;
and I recall them all three now as the
most beautiful pictures in the world. One—and
this, I think, was the first I ever saw—represented
an Italian view, with a lively volcano
in the background, and, in front, a long-legged
shepherd lad reclining on the marble
steps of a fountain, while his flock loitered
lazily around. Another displayed four stout
and dropsical nymphs preparing for, or resting
from, a hunt; this fact being adroitly intimated
by the presence of some very long bows, and
some very lean greyhounds. The third was a
seaport town, with vessels lying in harbor,
and a little terrace running to the water’s edge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
on which terrace I have taken many a stroll in
spirit, waiting for the wonders to come. Not
that the waits were ever long in those vanished
days. On the contrary, the whole evening
flew by on wings of fire, and the only
thought that marred my perfect felicity was
the haunting consciousness that it would too
soon be over. And the theatres were never hot,
or stuffy, or draughty, when I was a child;
and the lights were never glaring, but shone
with a gentle radiance; and the chairs were
softer than down; and the music was noble
and inspiring; and the actors were men of
genius; and the actresses were ravishingly
beautiful; and the scenery was sublime; and the
plays were wondrously witty; and the paste
jewels were dazzling; and <i>ennui</i> was unknown;
and I never, never, <i>never</i>, wished I had stayed
at home. What new drop-curtain hides from
me now the rapturous illusions of my youth?</p>

<p>Another grievance, more palpable because
less inevitable than the replacing of worn-out
theatre properties with fresh ones, is the passion
of publishers for altering the covers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
their magazines. This is the strangest act of
vandalism that an unholy zest for novelty
ever prompted in the human bosom. Why a
magazine cover is selected in the first place,
remains, in most cases, an unfathomed mystery.
It is seldom a thing of beauty, but, once associated
with the agreeable visitor that every
month brings some new tidings to our door, it
acquires for us all the subtle charm of familiarity.
Nothing can well be more stiff and ungraceful
than the design of <i>Blackwood</i>; that
wilted, conventional border, and that wreath
of prickly Scotch thistles, defending rather
than decorating the vignette of the founder,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“With eyes severe and beard of formal cut.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The whole cover seems to say, “Stand off,
rash mortal! There is nothing here for you!”
Yet to lose it would be to lose an old, surly,
faithful and long-tried friend. I sometimes
feel that <i>Blackwood</i> is not as readable as it
was when I was a girl—it is the privilege of
increasing years to think all magazines were
better when we were young—but for that very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
reason I am glad to greet the ancient thistles
that alone remain defiant and unchanged.</p>

<p>American publishers, however, are as delighted
to offer their readers a new cover as a
new story, and it is occasionally interesting to
follow a magazine through all its outer vicissitudes.
There was a time when <i>Saint Nicholas</i>
behaved like Harlequin in the pantomime,
slipping into fresh costumes with bewildering
alertness and rapidity. <i>The Century</i> has adopted
a plan eminently fitted to confuse and distress
people who are in love with the familiar,
and who have barely time to accustom themselves
to one of the picturesque young women
on its cover, before they are confronted with
another. The only engaging and comforting
thing about these rival damsels is their strong
family resemblance. They are like the fair
daughters of Doris, with faces “neither the
same nor different, but as those of sisters
should be.” The wanton alterations in <i>Harper’s
Magazine</i> are none the less heart-breaking
for being so trivial. As well rob us of an
old friend altogether as tamper with his absolute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
integrity. No one can claim for <i>Harper</i>
that its time-honored cover has any rare artistic
quality, any of that subtle and far-reaching
suggestiveness that we prize so wearily to-day.
On the contrary, its little boys scattering roses
into nowhere, and its preposterous child blowing
soap bubbles on a globe belong distinctly
to the cheerful school of Philistia, and are not
burdened with meanings of any kind. That
makes them so refreshing to our eyes; and besides
I have always regarded them with sincere
affection, because of the pleasure they afforded
me in infancy. It was one of the unwritten
laws of our nursery that, when a new magazine
arrived, the old one passed into our possession.
We painted all the pictures with water colors,
and we cut out the little figures on the cover
for paper dolls. Not the child straddling over
the globe! It was impossible to make anything
out of him, owing to his uncomfortable
position. But the lads in tunics we thought
extremely pretty, especially the one in the
right-hand corner, whose head was as round as
a bullet. The left-hand boy had a slightly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
flattened skull, which destroyed his perfect
symmetry, though we occasionally remedied
this defect by leaving him a small portion of his
basket, and pretending it was hair. Now, alas!
though the children still mount guard on their
flower-wreathed pedestals, and still scatter
their roses in the air, some unkind hand has
wrought radical changes in their aspect. They
have grown bigger, stouter, and their decent
little tunics, so nicely drawn up over one shoulder,
have been replaced by those absurd floating
draperies which form the conventional attire
of seraphs and sea nymphs all the world over.
Never was there such an unhappy transformation.
It is true that on the old cover of <i>Bentley’s
Magazine</i>—if we may trust the minute picture
of it on the face of <i>Littell</i>—the little figures
with baskets were clad, or unclad, in these same
airy rags. But this fact does not reconcile me
at all. I never knew <i>Bentley’s</i> boys, but I have
known <i>Harper’s</i> children all my life, and I cannot
bear to see them shivering month after
month in such ridiculous, inadequate sashes.
What sort of paper dolls would they have made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
for well-bred little girls? And why should
they have been deprived of their only garment
to gratify a restless taste for change?</p>

<p>Well, it is useless to complain, for around us
on every side people are fretting, and have
fretted for generations over the unloved monotony
of their surroundings. “It is not given
to the world to be contented,” says Goethe;
and while life can never hurry on fast enough,
or assume phases new enough to please the
majority of mankind, a few dissatisfied souls
will always cling perversely to the things
which they have known, and feel more keenly
every year that all the vaunted delights of novelty
and progress are but a poor substitute for
the finer charm of the familiar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OLD_WORLD_PETS">OLD WORLD PETS</h2>

</div>

<p>We have grown to be very narrow-minded,
very exclusive, and hopelessly unimaginative
in our choice of domestic pets. We
love and cherish the dog, and we have a sentiment,
less universal but far more disinterested,
in favor of the beautiful and cold-hearted cat.
We keep canaries in gilded cages—and there
the matter practically ends. A few rabbits in
a hutch—which are never petted—an occasional
parrot feared by its master and hated by its
master’s friends; a little song-bird imprisoned
now and then, and slowly dying of despair;
these are instances, happily too infrequent to
count very heavily in the scale. As a fact,
many people value the dog and cat for their
serviceable qualities alone; exiling the first to
the kennel and the second to the kitchen, and
liking both, as Miss Mitford confessed she liked
children, “in their place”—meaning any place
where she was not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>But when we turn back to the past we find,
or think we find, a very different state of affairs;
an almost endless variety of little wild creatures,
tamed by luxury and love. The dog
still holds his own, and we need look no further
than the <i>Odyssey</i> to see, in the great
hound Argus, the splendid sagacity, the unswerving
loyalty, which centuries have not altered
or impaired. I have always wished that
Argus could have had Sir Walter Scott, rather
than the crafty Odysseus for a master. There
is also a pathetic dialogue in Theocritus between
two old fishermen, who are so poor they
may not even own a watchdog to guard their
scanty spoils:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All things, all, to them seemed superfluity, for
Poverty was their sentinel. They had no neighbor by
them, but ever against their narrow cabin gently floated
up the sea.”</p>

</div>

<p>Cats, too, were valued pets in former days,
and probably found such easy domesticity
more to their tastes than the burdensome honors
of Egypt. In fact, when the Egyptian cat
was not living in sanctified seclusion as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
friend and favorite of Pasht, she was apparently
earning a laborious livelihood as a retriever,
if we may trust a relic of Egyptian art in the
British Museum, which shows us a magnificent
animal carrying no less than three struggling
wild fowls in her mouth and claws. But when
Puss at last entered Greece and Rome, about
the time of the Christian era, or perhaps a century
or two earlier, it was simply as a plaything;
and Mr. Pater in “Marius the Epicurean” describes
very charmingly the snow-white beast
brought by one of the guests to a Roman banquet,
and purring its way among the wine-cups
in response to caresses and coaxing words.
Mrs. Graham R. Tomson, that most winning
chronicler of the cat’s vicissitudes and triumphs,
has also told us in graceful verse the history of
a Greek lover who loses his mistress because
he dares not bring her from Egypt one of these
coveted and mysterious creatures:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">For this, through lands Egyptian far away</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">With gifts of furry creatures white and dun</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">From over-sea.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the Museum of Antiquities, at Bordeaux,
there is a mutilated tomb of the Gallo-Roman
period showing still the indistinct outlines of a
young girl and her two pets; a cat clasped—very
uncomfortably—in her arms, and, at her
feet, a dignified cock, which appears to be
pecking viciously at poor pussy’s drooping tail.</p>

<p>The few allusions we find to the cat in later
Greek poetry are hardly of a flattering nature.
Theocritus makes the impatient Praxinoë, in
his XVth Idyl, say to her handmaid, “Eunoë,
bring the water and put it down in the middle
of the room, lazy creature that you are! Cats
like always to sleep soft,”—quite as if it were
disgraceful in them to enjoy their ease. The
same passage is interpreted somewhat differently,
and in a still more uncharitable spirit by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Mr. Matthew Arnold: “Eunoë, pick up your
work, and take care, lazy girl, how you leave it
lying about again! The cats find it just the
bed they like.” At least we know, by this
token, that Puss was an inmate—understood if
not honored—of the Alexandrian household.
There is also a dog; for Praxinoë, on going
out, bids Phrygia, the nurse, “Take the child,
and keep him amused; call in the dog, and
shut the street door.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the very diversity of pets that
so often brought the cat into disgrace. She is
not wont to tolerate divided affections, and the
old primitive, savage instincts are very strong
within her little breast. Consequently, there
comes down to us out of the past a bitter wail
of lamentation from foolish mortals who seem
to have forgotten what a natural and wholesome
thing it is for one creature to devour another.
Agathias, a poet of the sixth century,
has left us two mournful epigrams upon a favorite
partridge ruthlessly done to death by a
swift-footed and hungry cat:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“O my partridge! Poor exile from the rocks and the
heath, thy little willow house possesses thee no longer.
No more dost thou rustle thy wings in the warmth of
the rising sun. A cat has torn off thy head. I seized
thy body and rescued it from his cruel jaws. Let the
earth lie not too lightly on thee, lest thy enemy discover
and drag thee from thy quiet grave.”</p>

</div>

<p>The second epigram is quite as disconsolate
and more vengeful in its tone:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The domestic cat which has eaten my partridge
flatters himself that he is still to live under my roof.
No, dear bird, I will not leave thee unavenged, but on
thy grave will I slay thy murderer. For thy shade,
which roams tormented, cannot be quieted until I shall
have done that which Pyrrhus did upon the grave of
Achilles.”</p>

</div>

<p>As if these direful threats were not enough,
Damocharis, a disciple of Agathias, follows up
the case with a third epigram in which he bewails
the cruelty of the cat, and compares it
with burning eloquence to one of Aktæon’s
hounds, which devoured its own master. “Here
is a pretty pother about a partridge!” protests
M. Champfleury, with the pardonable irritation
of one who is wont to deal leniently with the
shortcomings of his favorite animal, and who
fails to sympathize with this excess of grief.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Pet partridges, indeed, are hardly in accord
with modern taste, which is apt to regard them
from the same simple point of view as did the
cat of Agathias. Neither is the sparrow a
popular plaything as in the days when Lesbia
wept inconsolably for her dead bird, and Catullus
sang in silvery strains to soothe her wounded
heart. With what generous sympathy the
lover laments and calls on the Loves and
Graces, and on all the fair youths of Rome to
lament with him this shocking and irreparable
loss:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dead my Lesbia’s sparrow is,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sparrow that was all her bliss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than her very eyes more dear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How sombre is the picture he draws of the
little petted creature that in life never strayed
from the white bosom of its mistress, and that
now must tread alone the gloomy pathway
whence not even a bird may return. It is
really heartrending to listen to his grief:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Out upon you and your power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which all fairest things devour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orcus’ gloomy shades! that e’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye took my Bird that was so fair.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ah! the pity of it! Thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor Bird! thy doing ’tis that now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My Loved One’s eyes are swollen and red</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With weeping for her darling dead.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Almost as pathetic, and quite as musical as this
melancholy dirge, are some of the epigrams to
be found in that charming volume of translations
from the Greek Anthology, which Lilla
Cabot Perry has aptly entitled <i>From the Garden
of Hellas</i>. Here we have graceful and tender
verses dedicated to the memory of pet beasts
and birds and insects, one of them, indeed, bewailing
the hard fate of a locust and a cicada,
which, beloved by the same mistress, sleep,
equally lamented, side by side:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Unto the locust, nightingale of fields,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the cicada, who was wont to drowse</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Through summer heat amid the oaken boughs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This common tomb the maiden Myro builds;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And, like a child, weeps that she could not save</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">These twain, her cherished playthings, from the grave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What can be prettier than such a requiem sung
by Leonidas, and breathing in every line a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
sentiment half natural, half assumed! We
look back into the past, and smile, but with no
unfeeling mirth, to see the tiny tomb with its
cold and silent inmates whose shrill, amorous
music is hushed for evermore. Nor were they
alone in their sad distinction, for on every side
other deserving insects were as decorously interred,
and as tunefully bewailed. The poet
who mourned for the “maiden Myro’s” playthings,
was fain to sing with the same ready
sympathy and the same charming grace the
praises of Philænida’s pet locust, loved and lost:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What if small, O passer-by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Be this stone! ’tis mine you see.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What if it you scarce descry!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Philænida gave it me.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Praise her that she held me dear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Me, her little locust, singing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whether in the stubble here</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or amid the bushes winging.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Two long years she loved me well,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Loved my drowsy lullaby;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Me e’en dead did not repel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As these verses testify.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another epigram by Mnasalcas bewails a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
similar loss, and inclines us slowly to the painful
conviction that all Greece must have been
in mourning for these short-lived insects,
which, like poor Hinda’s tantalizing gazelles,
appear to have made a point of dying just when
they had grown most dear. It is a positive relief
to find Meleager dedicating his verses to a
pet cicada which is still alive and enjoying its
master’s tender care:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cicada, you who chase away desire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Cicada, who beguile our sleepless hours,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You song-winged muse of meadows and of flowers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who are the natural mimic of the lyre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chirp a familiar melody and sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My weight of sleepless care to drive away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Your love-beguiling tune to me now play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Striking your prattling wings with your dear feet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In early morning I’ll bring gifts to you</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of garlic ever fresh and drops of dew.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is an exquisite description in the first
Idyl of Theocritus of a deep bowl of ivy wood,
the gift of a goatherd to the singer Thyrsis, on
which is carved, among other pastoral scenes,
a boy weaving a locust cage while he guards
the vineyard from the foxes. Just such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
dainty toy he weaves as may well have been
the habitation of those luxurious and thrice-favored
insects, the petted captives of Myro
and fair Philænida:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now divided but a little space from the sea-worn
old man is a vineyard laden well with fire-red clusters,
and on the rough wall a little lad watches the vineyard,
sitting there. Round him two she-foxes are skulking,
and one goes along the vine rows to devour the ripe
grapes, and the other brings all her cunning to bear
against the scrip, and vows she will never leave the lad
till she strand him bare and breakfastless. But the boy
is plaiting a pretty locust cage with stalks of asphodel,
and fitting it with reeds; and less care of his scrip has
he, or of the vines, than delight in his plaiting.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Kids and lambs are pastoral playthings
which the rustic lovers of Theocritus delight in
offering to their fair ones; and in the Vth Idyl
Comatus complains to Lacon that he has given
a bird to Alcippe and won from her no kiss in
return. Whereupon Lacon, in the true spirit
of amorous boastfulness, protests that he gave
but a shepherd’s pipe to his maiden, and sweetly
she kissed and caressed him. A great hound,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
strong enough to strangle wolves, a mixing
bowl wrought by the hand of Praxiteles, a vessel
of cypress wood, a soft fleece from the
newly shorn ewe, and a brooding ring-dove
are among the presents offered by these shepherds
in generous rivalry at the shrine of love.</p>

<p>But by far the most winning pet whose
memory has come down to us enshrined in
Greek verse is the little wildwood hare, cherished
by a young girl, and sung by the poet
Meleager. Gentler and more affectionate than
Cowper’s sturdy favorites, it shares with them a
modest fame, a quiet corner in the long gallery
of prized and honored beasts. To those who
have loved Tiney and Puss from childhood, it is
a pleasure to see by their side this shrinking
stranger, this poor little overfed, much-caressed
darling whose race was quickly run:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From my mother’s teats they tore me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Little long-eared hare, and bore me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The swift-footed, from her breast.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Phanium, soft-handed, fed me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On spring flowers, and nourishèd me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fondling in her lap to rest.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No more for my mother sighing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Feasting daintily, then dying;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I by too much food was slain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she buried me with weeping</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Near her house, that she, while sleeping,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Me in dreams might see again.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On what smooth Elysian sward does this little
Grecian hare sport with his English cousins?
Fed, perchance, by Persephone’s white hand,
they gambol for evermore by the deep waters
of Oblivion; and the gray ghosts, flitting by,
smile with sad eyes upon the nimble creatures
who, shadows in shadowland, yet bear in every
limb rich memories of woodland glade, and of
the dear, life-giving soil of earth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BATTLE_OF_THE_BABIES">BATTLE OF THE BABIES</h2>

</div>

<p>A warfare has been raging in our
midst, the echoes of which have hardly
yet died sullenly away upon either side of the
Atlantic. It has been a bloodless and un-Homeric
strife, not without humorous side-issues,
as when Pistol and Bardolph and Fluellen
come to cheer our anxious spirits at the
siege of Harfleur. Its first guns were heard in
New York, where a modest periodical, devoted
to the training of parents, opened fire upon
those time-honored nursery legends which are
presumably dear to the hearts of all rightly
constituted babies. The leader of this gallant
foray protested vehemently against all fairy
tales of a mournful or sanguinary cast, and her
denunciation necessarily included many stories
which have for generations been familiar to
every little child. She rejected <i>Red Riding
Hood</i>, because her own infancy was haunted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
and embittered by the evil behavior of the
wolf; she would have none of <i>Bluebeard</i>, because
he was a wholesale fiend and murderer;
she would not even allow the pretty <i>Babes in
the Wood</i>, because they tell a tale of cold-hearted
cruelty and of helpless suffering;
while all fierce narratives of giants and ogres
and magicians were to be banished ruthlessly
from our shelves. Verily, reading will be but
gentle sport in the virtuous days to come.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that this serious protest
against nursery lore fell into the hands of Mr.
Andrew Lang, the most light-hearted and
conservative of critics, and partial withal to
tales of bloodshed and adventure. How could
it be otherwise with one reared on the bleak
border land, and familiar from infancy with the
wild border legends that Sir Walter knew and
loved; with stories of Thomas the Rhymer,
and the plundering Hardens, and the black
witches of Loch Awe! It was natural that
with the echoes of the old savage strife ringing
in his ears, and with the memories of the dour
Scottish bogies and warlocks lingering in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
heart, Mr. Lang could but indifferently sympathize
with those anxious parents who think
the stories of Bluebeard and Jack the Giant
Killer too shocking for infant ears to hear.
Our grandmothers, he declared, were not
ferocious old ladies, yet they told us these
tales, and many more which we were none
the worse for hearing. “Not to know them is
to be sadly ignorant, and to miss that which
all people have relished in all ages.” Moreover,
it is apparent to him, and indeed to most
of us, that we cannot take even our earliest
steps in the world of literature, or in the shaded
paths of knowledge, without encountering
suffering and sin in some shape; while, as we
advance a little further, these grisly forms fly
ever on before. “Cain,” remarks Mr. Lang,
“killed Abel. The flood drowned quite a
number of persons. David was not a stainless
knight, and Henry VIII. was nearly as bad as
Bluebeard. Several deserving gentlemen were
killed at Marathon. Front de Bœuf came to
an end shocking to sensibility, and to Mr. Ruskin.”
The <i>Arabian Nights</i>, <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
<i>Paul and Virginia</i>—all the dear old nursery
favorites must, under the new dispensation,
be banished from our midst; and the rising
generation of prigs must be nourished exclusively
on <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i>, and other
carefully selected specimens of milk-and-water
diet.</p>

<p>The prospect hardly seems inviting; but as
the English guns rattled merrily away in behalf
of English tradition, they were promptly
met by an answering roar from this side of the
water. A Boston paper rushed gallantly to
the defense of the New York periodical, and
gave Mr. Lang—to use a pet expression of his
own—“his kail through the reek.” American
children, it appears, are too sensitively organized
to endure the unredeemed ferocity of the
old fairy stories. The British child may sleep
soundly in its little cot after hearing about the
Babes in the Wood; the American infant is
prematurely saddened by such unmerited misfortune.
“If a consensus of American mothers
could be taken,” says the Boston writer,
“our English critic might be infinitely disgusted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
to know in how many nurseries these
cruel tales must be changed, or not told at all
to the children of less savage generations. No
mother nowadays tells them in their unmitigated
brutality.”</p>

<p>Is this true, I wonder, and are our supersensitive
babies reared perforce on the optimistic
version of Red Riding Hood, where the wolf
is cut open by the woodman, and the little
girl and her grandmother jump out, safe and
sound? Their New England champion speaks
of the “intolerable misery”—a very strong
phrase—which he suffered in infancy from having
his nurse tell him of the Babes in the
Wood; while the Scriptural stories were apparently
every whit as unbearable and heart-breaking.
“I remember,” he says, “two children,
strong, brave man and woman now, who
in righteous rage plucked the Slaughter of the
Innocents out from the family Bible.” This
was a radical measure, to say the least, and if
many little boys and girls started in to expurgate,
the Scriptures in such liberal fashion, the
holy book would soon present a sadly mutilated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
appearance. Moreover, it seems to me
that such an anecdote, narrated with admirable
assurance, reveals very painfully the lack
of a fine and delicate spirituality in the religious
training of children; of that grace and
distinction which are akin to saintship, and are
united so charmingly in those to whom truth
has been inseparably associated with beauty.
There is a painting by Ghirlandaio hanging
over the altar in the chapel of the Foundling
Asylum in Florence. It represents the Adoration
of the Magi, and kneeling by the side of
the Wise Men is a little group of the Holy Innocents,
their tiny garments stained with
blood, their hands clasped in prayer; while the
Divine Child turns from his mother’s embraces,
and from the kings’ rich gifts to greet the little
companions who have yielded up their spotless
lives for him. Now, surely those lean, brown
Florentine orphans, who have always before
their eyes this beautiful and tender picture, absorb
through it alone a religious sentiment unfelt
by American children who are familiar
only with the ugly and inane prints of American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
Sunday-schools, in which I have known
the line, “My soul doth magnify the Lord,” to
be illustrated by a man with a magnifying-glass
in his hand. Possibly our Sunday-school
scholars, being more accurately instructed
as to dates, could inform the little
Florentines that the Innocents were not
slaughtered until after the Magi had returned
to the East. But no child who had looked
day after day upon Ghirlandaio’s lovely picture—more
appealing in its pathos than Holman
Hunt’s brilliant and jocund Triumph of
the Innocents—could desire to pluck “in
righteous rage” that chapter from the Bible.
He would have at least some dim and imperfect
conception of the spiritual meaning, the
spiritual joy, which underlie the pain and horror
of the story.</p>

<p>This reflection will help us in some measure
to come to a decision, when we return to the
vexed problem of nursery tales and legends.
I believe it is as well to cultivate a child’s
emotions as to cultivate his manners or his
morals, and the first step in such a direction is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
necessarily taken through the stories told him
in infancy. If a consensus of mothers would
reject the good old fairy tales “in their unmitigated
brutality,” a consensus of men of letters
would render a different verdict; and such
men, who have been children in their time,
and who look back with wistful delight upon
the familiar figures who were their earliest
friends, are entitled to an opinion in the case.
How admirable was the “righteous rage” of
Charles Lamb, when he wanted to buy some
of these same brutal fairy stories for the little
Coleridges, and could find nothing but the
correct and commonplace literature which his
whole soul abhorred! “Mrs. Barbauld’s and
Mrs. Trimmer’s nonsense lay in piles about,”
he wrote indignantly to papa Coleridge, “and
have banished all the old classics of the nursery.
Knowledge, insignificant and vapid as
Mrs. Barbauld’s books convey, must, it seems,
come to a child in the shape of knowledge;
and his empty noddle must be turned with
conceit of his own powers when he has learnt
that a horse is an animal, and that Billy is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
better than a horse, and such like; instead of
that beautiful interest in wild tales which made
the child a man, while all the time he suspected
himself to be no bigger than a child.”</p>

<p>Just such a wild tale, fantastic rather than
beautiful, haunted Châteaubriand all his life—the
story of Count Combourg’s wooden leg,
which, three hundred years after its owner’s
death, was seen at night walking solemnly
down the steep turret stairs, attended by a
huge black cat. Not at all the kind of story
we would select to tell a child nowadays. By
no means! Even the little Châteaubriand
heard it from peasant lips. Yet in after years,
when he had fought the battle of life, and
fought it with success; when he had grown
gray, and illustrious, and disillusioned, and
melancholy, what should come back to his
mind, with its old pleasant flavor of terror
and mystery, but the vision of Count Combourg’s
wooden leg taking its midnight constitutional,
with the black cat stepping softly on
before? So he notes it gravely down in his
Memoirs, just as Scott notes in his diary the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
pranks of Whippity Stourie, the Scotch bogie
that steals at night into open nursery windows;
and just as Heine, in gay, sunlit Paris,
recalls with joy the dark, sweet, sombre tales
of the witch and fairy haunted forests of Germany.</p>

<p>These are impressions worth recording, and
they are only a few out of many which may be
gathered from similar sources. That which is
vital in literature or tradition, which has survived
the obscurity and wreckage of the past,
whether as legend, or ballad, or mere nursery
rhyme, has survived in right of some intrinsic
merit of its own, and will not be snuffed out of
existence by any of our precautionary or hygienic
measures. We could not banish Bluebeard
if we would. He is as immortal as Hamlet,
and when hundreds of years shall have
passed over this uncomfortably enlightened
world, the children of the future—who, thank
Heaven, can never, with all our efforts, be
born grown up—will still tremble at the blood-stained
key, and rejoice when the big brave
brothers come galloping up the road. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
could not even rid ourselves of Mother Goose,
though she, too, has her mortal enemies, who
protest periodically against her cruelty and
grossness. We could not drive Punch and
Judy from our midst, though Mr. Punch’s derelictions
have been the subject of much serious
and adverse criticism. It is not by such barbarous
rhymes or by such brutal spectacles
that we teach a child the lessons of integrity
and gentleness, explain our nursery moralists,
and probably they are correct. Moreover,
Bluebeard does not teach a lesson of conjugal
felicity, and Cinderella is full of the world’s
vanities, and Puss in Boots is one long record
of triumphant effrontery and deception. An
honest and self-respecting lad would have explained
to the king that he was not the Marquis
of Carabas at all; that he had no desire to
profit by his cat’s ingenious falsehoods, and no
weak ambition to connect himself with the
aristocracy. Such a hero would be a credit to
our modern schoolrooms, and lift a load of
care from the shoulders of our modern critics.
Only the children would have none of him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
but would turn wistfully back to those brave
old tales which are their inheritance from a
splendid past, and of which no hand shall
rob them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NOVEL_OF_INCIDENT">THE NOVEL OF INCIDENT</h2>

</div>

<p>A great deal of generous scorn has been
expended of late years upon those old-fashioned
novels in which the characters were
given plenty to do, and did it with a supreme
energy and passion, only possible, perhaps,
within the enchanted precincts of fiction. Such
stories, we are told, are false to life, which is
monotonous, uneventful, and made up day by
day of minute and tedious detail, small pleasures
which are hardly recognizable as such,
and grim vexations which can never be persuaded
to assume noble or heroic proportions.
The truthful representation of life being the
only worthy object of a novelist’s skill, it follows
that his tale should be destitute of any incidents
save those with which we are all familiar
in the narrow routine of existence. We
should be able to verify them by experience—to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
prove them, as children prove their examples
at school.</p>

<p>To meet these current severities of realism,
the advocates of a livelier fiction unite in saying
a great many sarcastic and amusing things
about the deadly dulness of their opponents;
about the hero and heroine who, in the course
of three volumes, “agree not to become engaged,”
and about the lady’s subtle reasons for
dropping her handkerchief, or passing a cruet
at table. It may be hard work to build up a
novel out of nothing, they admit, but we can
only echo Dr. Johnson’s words, and wish it
were impossible. Where is the gain in this
perpetual unfolding of the obvious? What is
the advantage of wasting genuine ability upon
a task the difficulties of which constitute its
sole claim to distinction?</p>

<p>But <i>is</i> the so-called novel of character more
difficult to write than the novel of romance?
This question can be answered satisfactorily
only by an author who has done both kinds of
work sufficiently well to make his opinion valuable;
and, so far, no such versatile genius has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
appeared in the field of letters. If we may
judge by results, we should say that artistic labor
is as rare in one school of fiction as in the
other, and apparently as far out of the reach of
the ordinary champion in the arena. It is easy
enough to be analytic; but it is extremely hard
to be luminous, or interpretative, or to know
when analysis counts. It is easy to stuff a book
full of incidents; but it is hard to make those
incidents living pages in literature. After De
Foe had led the way with <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, a
whole army of imitators wrote similar tales of
adventure; but Robinson Crusoe is to-day the
only shipwrecked mariner whose every action
awakens interest and delight. Mr. Stevenson
in <i>The Black Arrow</i>, and Mr. Rider Haggard
in <i>Nada the Lily</i>, have given us stories
rich in horrors which do not horrify, and excitements
which do not excite. Mr. Stevenson’s
tale is one bewildering succession of murders,
plots, hairbreadth escapes, bloody skirmishes,
and perils by field and flood; yet a gentle indifference
as to which side wins is the only distinct
sentiment with which we follow the windings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
of his narrative. Sir Daniel is a perjured
villain; but it is with no stern sense of just retribution
that we see him fall under the fatal
arrow. Master Dick is a stout young soldier;
but where is the breathless attention with which
we pursue every step of another young soldier,
equally brave and quick-witted, Quentin Durward
of Glen-houlakin? Even Joan in her
doublet and hose—a device dear to the heart
of the romanticist—is almost as uninteresting
as Joan in her petticoats; though perhaps the
most striking scene in the book is that in which
Dick endeavors with hearty good will to administer
a little well-deserved chastisement to
the supposed boy, and finds himself withheld
by some subtle apprehension of a secret he is
far from suspecting. To compare <i>The Black
Arrow</i> with <i>Ivanhoe</i> or <i>Quentin Durward</i>
is manifestly unjust. It is no shame to any
man to be surpassed by Scott. But when
we remember the admirable and satisfying
events in <i>Treasure Island</i>, or the well-sustained
interest of <i>Kidnapped</i>, it seems incredible
that Mr. Stevenson, of all novelists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
should have succeeded in telling a lifeless story
of adventure.</p>

<p>As for <i>Nada the Lily</i>, its incidents are too
monotonously painful to do more than distress
the reader. I am inclined to think that a greater
number of people die in the course of this
tale than in all the rest of English fiction, exclusive
of Mr. Haggard’s other novels. They
die singly, in pairs, in groups, in armies, in
whole tribes. They die in battle, by fire, by
torture, by starvation, at the hands of pitiless
slaughterers, and under the fangs of ghost
wolves. They die for every imaginable cause,
and under every conceivable circumstance. To
keep the death-rate of such a story would be
like keeping the death-rate of the Deluge.
There is the same comprehensive and all-embracing
destruction. This maybe true to Zulu
history—in fact, Mr. Haggard tells us as much
in his preface to “Nada,” and few people are
in a position to dispute the point; but it is radically
false to art, and impairs the natural vigor
of the tale. While one tragedy may be sombre
and impressive, a dozen are apt to be fatiguing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
and half a hundred border closely on
the burlesque. Chaka, “a Napoleon and Tiberius
in one,” reminds the irreverent reader irresistibly
of the Queen in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
who is all the time saying, “Off with his head!”
and ordering everybody to execution; the only
difference being that the Queen’s victims turn
up blandly in the next chapter, and Chaka’s
never reappear. He it is who slays Unandi
his mother, Baleka his wife, all his children
save one, all his enemies, and most of his
friends. Then his turn comes—and none too
soon—to be murdered, and Dingaan his brother,
“who had the fierce heart of Chaka without
its greatness,” sets to work systematically to kill
everybody who chances to be left. By the time
he, too, is flung over the cliff to die, Mopo and
Umslopogaas alone survive; the first because he
has to tell the tale—after which he promptly expires—and
the second because he has already
been slain in battle during the progress of another
story. The most curious thing about this
wholesale devastation is that Mr. Haggard apparently
deplores it as much as the rest of us. “It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
would have been desirable to introduce some
gayer and more happy incidents,” he admits in
his preface, “<i>but it has not been possible</i>.” Why
has it not been possible, we wonder? It is the
privilege of a novelist to select or discard material
according to his good judgment. He is not
writing a history; he is telling a story. He is
not chronicling events; he is weaving a romance.
He is an artist, not a recorder; and in the
choice as well as in the use of material lies the
test of unblemished art.</p>

<p>What, then, is the vital charm which makes
the novel of incident true literature—the charm
possessed by Dumas, and Fielding, and Sir Walter
Scott? Mr. Birrell, who is always in love
with plain definitions, says that if a book be
full of “inns, atmosphere, and motion,” then it
is a good book, and he asks no more. Mr.
Lang, who shares this hearty sympathy for action,
acknowledges that the best results are often
obtained by the simplest machinery. “Dumas,”
he declares, “requires no more than a
room in an inn, where people meet in riding-cloaks,
to move the heart with the last degree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
of pity and terror.” Scott handles incident
with the matchless skill of a great story-teller.
He shows the same instinctive art in his situations
that a great painter like Rembrandt
shows in his grouping. Every figure falls so
inevitably into his right place that it is impossible
for us to imagine him in any other. Henry
Bertram’s return to Ellengowan is one of the
most artistic and charming scenes in fiction,
though it is described with such careless simplicity.
Perplexed and fascinated by the childish
memories tugging at his heartstrings, the
young laird gazes at his ancestral home, and
listens with rapture—which we share—to the
fragment of a long-forgotten yet familiar song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Are these the Links of Forth,” she said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Or are they the crooks of Dee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or the bonnie woods of Warroch-head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That I so fain would see?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There may be people who are in no way
moved by this home-coming, and who feel no joy
when Queen Mary’s boat glides over the dark
waters of Lochleven, and no horror at that ill-omened
churchyard gossip which ushers in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
dreadful wedding of Lammermoor. I do not
envy them their composure; but what of King
Louis’s visit to the Duke of Burgundy in
<i>Quentin Durward</i>, a situation so tense with
passion that the least imaginative reader may
well tremble at the possibilities of every minute?
What of the sacking of Liege, the siege
of Front de Bœuf’s castle, the trial of Rebecca,
the battle of Bothwell Bridge? He who could
carry a chilly indifference through such narratives
as these would not care if Shylock gained
his suit, or King Harry lost the field of Agincourt.
I doubt if he would really care whether
Hector or Achilles won the fight.</p>

<p>The casual incidents of life, the trivial possibilities
of every day, are treated by Dickens
with extraordinary humor and skill; witness
David Copperfield’s journey to Dover, and
Oliver Twist’s first introduction to Fagin’s den.
But his great situations are apt to be theatrical
rather than dramatic. It is not often that he
reaches the sombre strength and passion of
that memorable scene where the convict reveals
to Pip the secret of his mysterious wealth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
I do not know whether a great many people
read Bulwer’s novels nowadays. They belong
to a past generation, which perhaps was luckier
than the present. But I do know that the rescue
of Glaucus from the arena was an epoch in
my childhood, and the cry of joy that rings
from Nydia’s lips rang in my heart for years.
I have an inexpressible tenderness now for
<i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>, because of the passionate
suspense with which I read it when I
was a little girl, and the supreme gasp of relief
with which I hailed the arrival of Sallust and
Calenus, while the lion crouches trembling in
his cage. It is not easy to criticise a book
linked with such vivid memories, and perhaps
it is the association with early pleasures which
gilds for many of us the beguiling pages of romance.
“We are all homesick, in the dark
days and black towns, for the land of blue
skies and brave adventures in forests, and in
lonely inns, on the battle-field, in the prison,
on the desert isle.” It is useless, and worse
than useless, to dispute over the respective
schools of fiction, instead of gladly enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
that which we like best; and there are different
kinds of enjoyment for different kinds of work.
For my part, the good novel of character is
the novel I can always pick up; but the good
novel of incident is the novel I can never lay
down.</p>

Union.</i></p>

<p>“Mrs. Cavazza has made a great beginning in these stories,
which will bear more than one reading, and which, as the work
of a New England woman, are very remarkable. They are

cents.</p>

</div>

<p class="hanging"><b>Adventures of a Fair Rebel.</b>—By <span class="smcap">Matt Crim</span>. This
novel is the record of a deeply passionate nature, the

to take service in the Northern army. Striking descriptions
of the campaign in Georgia and the siege of Atlanta
are given. With a frontispiece by Dan Beard.
Cloth, 8vo, $1.00. Paper, 50 cents.</p>

Union.</i></p>

Adventures of a Fair Rebel.’”—<i>Atlanta Herald.</i></p>

<p>“The incidents are varied, and the interest is never allowed
to flag from opening to close of this enjoyable novel.”—<i>Philadelphia
Ledger.</i></p>

<p>“The style is simple and straightforward, with fine touches
here and there.... The showing forth of the best aspects
on both sides of the dreadful struggle is skillfully done, avoiding
false sentiment, and maintaining an almost judicial tone,
which does not, however, lessen the interest of the story.”—<i>The
Nation.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="hanging"><b>The Master of Silence. A Romance.</b>—By <span class="smcap">Irving
Bacheller</span>. Readers of Mr. Bacheller’s stories and

Fancy Series.”) Cloth, 12mo, 75 cents.</p>

Bacheller, of the newspaper syndicate, and deals in a striking
way with the faculty of mind-reading.”—<i>New York World.</i></p>

Altogether the story is a strange character study, full
of suggestion, earnest in moral purpose, and worthy of attention.”—<i>Cincinnati
Enquirer.</i></p>

<p>“There is no let up in the intrigue of ‘The Master of Silence,’
and there is plot and action enough in it to construct a bookcase
full of novels by Howells &amp; James.”—<i>Cambridge Tribune.</i></p>

Beard</span>. In “Moonblight” the artist-author has brought
into play all those resources of humor, imagination,
and sarcasm for which he is so well known, to teach
under the guise of a romance the lesson of the wrongs
inflicted by capital on labor. In the light of recent
events at the Homestead mills, this book seems to have
been prophetic. Illustrated by the author. Cloth, 8vo,
$1.00.</p>

<div class="reviews">

<p>“A strange but powerful book.”—<i>Philadelphia Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>“He does not construct a Utopia like Bellamy; the reforms
he proposes are sensible and would be profitable, if greedy
capital could be induced to consider and try them.”—<i>Springfield
Republican.</i></p>

<p>“It is a witty, gay, poetical book, full of bright things and
true things, the seer donning a jester’s garb to preach in: and
one may be sure, under the shrug and the smile, of the keen
dart aimed at pride, prejudice, self-seeking, injustice, and the
praise for whatsoever is beautiful and good.”—<i>Hartford
Courant.</i></p>

of Tolstoi’s fables, and the work of translation is admirably
performed.”—<i>Chicago Standard.</i></p>

Tolstoi</span>. Translated direct from the Russian by Count

convenient volume which all those who enjoy the author’s inimitable

readable from the opening sentence to the closing line.”—<i>New
Orleans States.</i></p>

</div>

<h3>Poetry.</h3>

<p class="hanging"><b>Selected Poems by Walt Whitman.</b>—Chosen and
edited by Arthur Stedman. Shortly before Mr. Whitman’s
death, the old poet for the first time consented to
the publication of a selection from “Leaves of Grass,”
embracing his most popular short poems and representative
passages from his longer lyrical efforts. Arranged
for home and school use. With a portrait of the author.
(“Fiction, Fact, and Fancy Series.”) Cloth,
12mo, 75 cents.</p>

<div class="reviews">

<p>“Mr. Stedman’s choice is skilfully made.”—<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p>“The volume represents all that is best in Walt Whitman.”—<i>San
Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“That in Walt Whitman which is virile and bardic, lyrically
fresh and sweet, or epically grand and elemental, will be preserved
to the edification of young men and maidens, as well as
of maturer folk.”—<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p>“The intention of the editor has been to offer those of Whitman’s
poems which are most truly representative of his genius.
The selections have been well made, and those who have yet
to make acquaintance with this most original of American
poets will have reason to thank the publishers for this little
volume.”—<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="hanging"><b>Flower o’ the Vine: Romantic Ballads and Sospiri
di Roma.</b>—By <span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>, author of “A
Fellowe and His Wife” (with Miss Howard), “Life
and Letters of Joseph Severn,” etc. With an introduction
by Thomas A. Janvier, and a portrait of the author.
As one of the most popular of the younger English
poets, equal success is anticipated for this first American
edition of Mr. Sharp’s poems. Its welcome in the
American press has been most hearty. Tastefully
bound, with appropriate decorative design. Cloth,
8vo, $1.50.</p>

<div class="reviews">

<p>“This volume of verse, by Mr. William Sharp, has a music
like that of the meeting of two winds, one blown down from
the Northern seas, keen and salty, the other carrying on its
wings the warm fragrance of Southern fields.”—<i>The Literary
World.</i></p>

<p>“These old ballads, whether in Scottish dialect or not, are
transfused with the wild, uncanny, shivering character of all
the old myths of the North, a strange pungent chill, so to
speak, as if the breath that gave them voice were blown across
leagues of iceberg and glacier.”—<i>Chicago Times.</i></p>

<p>“When Mr. Sharp leaves the North with its wild stories of
love and fighting and death, and carries us away with him in
the ‘Sospiri di Roma’ to the warmth and the splendor of the
South, he equally shows the creative faculty. He is a true
lover of Earth with her soothing-touch and soft caress: he lies
in her arms, he hears her whispered secret, and through the
real discovers the spiritual.”—<i>Philadelphia Record.</i></p>

<p>“The poems combine a gracefulness of rhythm and a subtle
sweetness.”—<i>Baltimore American.</i></p>

</div>

Ireland</span>. A remarkable biography of a wonderful
